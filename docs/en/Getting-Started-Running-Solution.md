> This document assumes that you prefer to use **{{ UI_Value }}** as the UI framework and **{{ DB_Value }}** as the database provider. For other options, please change the preference on top of this document.

## Create the Database

### Connection String

Check the **connection string** in the `appsettings.json` file under the {{if Tiered == "Yes"}}`.AuthServer` and `.HttpApi.Host` projects{{else}}{{if UI=="MVC"}}`.Web` project{{else if UI=="BlazorServer"}}`.Blazor` project{{else}}`.HttpApi.Host` project{{end}}{{end}}.

{{ if DB == "EF" }}

````json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "Default": "Server=(LocalDb)\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=BookStore;Trusted_Connection=True"
}
````

> **About the Connection Strings and Database Management Systems**
>
> The solution is configured to use **Entity Framework Core** with **MS SQL Server** by default. However, if you've selected another DBMS using the `-dbms` parameter on the ABP CLI `new` command (like `-dbms MySQL`), the connection string might be different for you.
>
> EF Core supports [various](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/) database providers and you can use any supported DBMS. See [the Entity Framework integration document](Entity-Framework-Core.md) to learn how to [switch to another DBMS](Entity-Framework-Core-Other-DBMS.md) if you need later.

### Database Migrations

The solution uses the [Entity Framework Core Code First Migrations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/?tabs=dotnet-core-cli). It comes with a `.DbMigrator` console application which **applies the migrations** and also **seeds the initial data**. It is useful on **development** as well as on **production** environment.

> `.DbMigrator` project has its own `appsettings.json`. So, if you have changed the connection string above, you should also change this one. 

### The Initial Migration

`.DbMigrator` application automatically **creates the Initial migration** on first run. 

**If you are using Visual Studio, you can skip to the *Running the DbMigrator* section.** However, other IDEs (e.g. Rider) may have problems for the first run since it adds the initial migration and compiles the project. In this case, open a command line terminal in the folder of the `.DbMigrator` project and run the following command:

````bash
dotnet run
````

For the next time, you can just run it in your IDE as you normally do.

### Running the DbMigrator

Right click to the `.DbMigrator` project and select **Set as StartUp Project**

![set-as-startup-project](images/set-as-startup-project.png)

 Hit F5 (or Ctrl+F5) to run the application. It will have an output like shown below:

 ![db-migrator-output](images/db-migrator-output.png)

> Initial [seed data](Data-Seeding.md) creates the `admin` user in the database (with the password is `1q2w3E*`) which is then used to login to the application. So, you need to use `.DbMigrator` at least once for a new database.

{{ else if DB == "Mongo" }}

````json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "Default": "mongodb://localhost:27017/BookStore"
}
````

The solution is configured to use **MongoDB** in your local computer, so you need to have a MongoDB server instance up and running or change the connection string to another MongoDB server.

### Seed Initial Data

The solution comes with a `.DbMigrator` console application which **seeds the initial data**. It is useful on **development** as well as on **production** environment.

> `.DbMigrator` project has its own `appsettings.json`. So, if you have changed the connection string above, you should also change this one. 

Right click to the `.DbMigrator` project and select **Set as StartUp Project**

![set-as-startup-project](images/set-as-startup-project.png)

 Hit F5 (or Ctrl+F5) to run the application. It will have an output like shown below:

 ![db-migrator-output](images/db-migrator-output.png)

> Initial [seed data](Data-Seeding.md) creates the `admin` user in the database (with the password is `1q2w3E*`) which is then used to login to the application. So, you need to use `.DbMigrator` at least once for a new database.

{{ end }}

## Run the Application

{{ if UI == "MVC" || UI == "BlazorServer" }}

> Before starting the application, run `abp install-libs` command in your Web directory to restore the client-side libraries. This will populate the `libs` folder.

{{ if Tiered == "Yes" }}

> Tiered solutions use **Redis** as the distributed cache. Ensure that it is installed and running in your local computer. If you are using a remote Redis Server, set the configuration in the `appsettings.json` files of the projects below.

1. Ensure that the `.AuthServer` project is the startup project. Run this application that will open a **login** page in your browser.

> Use Ctrl+F5 in Visual Studio (instead of F5) to run the application without debugging. If you don't have a debug purpose, this will be faster.

You can login, but you cannot enter to the main application here. This is **just the authentication server**.

2. Ensure that the `.HttpApi.Host` project is the startup project and run the application which will open a **Swagger UI** in your browser.

![swagger-ui](images/swagger-ui.png)

This is the HTTP API that is used by the web application.

3. Lastly, ensure that the {{if UI=="MVC"}}`.Web`{{else}}`.Blazor`{{end}} project is the startup project and run the application which will open a **welcome** page in your browser

![mvc-tiered-app-home](images/bookstore-home.png)

Click to the **login** button which will redirect you to the *authentication server* to login to the application:

![bookstore-login](images/bookstore-login.png)

{{ else # Tiered != "Yes" }}

Ensure that the {{if UI=="MVC"}}`.Web`{{else}}`.Blazor`{{end}} project is the startup project. Run the application which will open the **login** page in your browser:

> Use Ctrl+F5 in Visual Studio (instead of F5) to run the application without debugging. If you don't have a debug purpose, this will be faster.

![bookstore-login](images/bookstore-login.png)

{{ end # Tiered }}

{{ else # UI != MVC || BlazorServer }}

### Running the HTTP API Host (Server Side)

{{ if Tiered == "Yes" }}

> Tiered solutions use Redis as the distributed cache. Ensure that it is installed and running in your local computer. If you are using a remote Redis Server, set the configuration in the `appsettings.json` files of the projects below.

Ensure that the `.AuthServer` project is the startup project. Run the application which will open a **login** page in your browser.

> Use Ctrl+F5 in Visual Studio (instead of F5) to run the application without debugging. If you don't have a debug purpose, this will be faster.

You can login, but you cannot enter to the main application here. This is **just the authentication server**.

Ensure that the `.HttpApi.Host` project is the startup project and run the application which will open a Swagger UI:

{{ else # Tiered == "No" }}

Ensure that the `.HttpApi.Host` project is the startup project and run the application which will open a Swagger UI:

> Use Ctrl+F5 in Visual Studio (instead of F5) to run the application without debugging. If you don't have a debug purpose, this will be faster.

{{ end # Tiered }}

![swagger-ui](images/swagger-ui.png)

You can see the application APIs and test them here. Get [more info](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) about the Swagger UI.

{{ end # UI }}

{{ if UI == "Blazor" }}

### Running the Blazor Application (Client Side)

Go to the Blazor project folder, open a command line terminal, type the `abp bundle -f` command (If the project was created by ABP Cli tool, you don't need to do this).

Ensure that the `.Blazor` project is the startup project and run the application.

> Use Ctrl+F5 in Visual Studio (instead of F5) to run the application without debugging. If you don't have a debug purpose, this will be faster.

Once the application starts, click to the **Login** link on to header, which redirects you to the authentication server to enter a username and password:

![bookstore-login](images/bookstore-login.png)

{{ else if UI == "NG" }}

### Running the Angular Application (Client Side)

Go to the `angular` folder, open a command line terminal, type the `yarn` command (we suggest to the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager while `npm install` will also work)

```bash
yarn
```

Once all node modules are loaded, execute `yarn start` (or `npm start`) command:

```bash
yarn start
```

It may take a longer time for the first build. Once it finishes, it opens the Angular UI in your default browser with the [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200/) address.

![bookstore-login](images/bookstore-login.png)

{{ end }}

Enter **admin** as the username and **1q2w3E*** as the password to login to the application. The application is up and running. You can start developing your application based on this startup template.
