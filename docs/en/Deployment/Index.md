# Deployment

Deploying an ABP application is not different than deploying any .NET or ASP.NET Core application. You can deploy it to a cloud provider (e.g. Azure, AWS, Google Could) or on-premise server, IIS or any other web server. ABP's documentation doesn't contain much information on deployment. You can refer to your provider's documentation.

However, there are some topics that you should care about when you are deploying your applications. Most of them are general software deployment considerations, but you should understand how to handle them within your ABP based applications. We've prepared guides for this purpose and we suggest you to read these guides carefully before designing your deployment configuration.
