# ABP Framework Road Map

This document provides a road map, release schedule and planned features for the ABP Framework.

## Next Versions

### v8.0

The next version will be 8.0 and planned to release the stable 8.0 version in December, 2023. We will be mostly working on the following topics:

* Enabling nullable annotations for all projects ([#16610](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/issues/16610))
* Upgrade to .NET 8.0 ([#17355](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/issues/17355))
* Use NoTracking for readonly repositories for EF Core ([#597](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/issues/597))
* Support mapping collection of objects for custom object mappers ([#94](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/issues/94))
* Improvements on the existing features and provide more guides.

See the [8.0 milestone](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/milestone/88) for all the issues we've planned to work on.
