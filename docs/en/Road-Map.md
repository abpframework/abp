# ABP Framework Road Map

This document provides a road map, release schedule and planned features for the ABP Framework.

## Next Versions

### v7.0

In the [7.0 milestone](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/milestone/75), we will be mostly working on the following topics:

* Dapr integration ([#13337](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/issues/13337))
* Upgrade to .NET 7.0 ([#13336](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/issues/13336))
* Integration Services ([#12470](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/issues/12470))
* Maturing and documenting the [eShopOnAbp](https://github.com/abpframework/eShopOnAbp) project, writing a free e-book that explains the solution.
* Working on the [LeptonX](https://blog.abp.io/abp/LeptonX-Theme-for-ABP-Framework-Alpha-Release) theme.
* Improvements on the existing features and providing more guides.

The planned stable release date for v7.0 is **December, 2022**. We will be publishing more than one pre-release versions before that date.

## Backlog Items

The *Next Versions* section above shows the main focus of the planned versions. However, in each release we add new features to the core framework and the [application modules](Modules/Index.md).
