# ABP Framework Road Map

This document provides a road map, release schedule and planned features for the ABP Framework.

## Next Versions

### v5.1

In [5.1 milestone](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/milestone/60), we will be mostly working on the following topics:

* Maturing and documenting the [eShopOnAbp](https://github.com/abpframework/eShopOnAbp) project.
* Working on the [LeptonX](https://blog.abp.io/abp/LeptonX-Theme-for-ABP-Framework-Alpha-Release) theme and making it as the default theme for the ABP Framework UI options.
* Flexing the UI-backend dependency for the Angular UI, so we can easily create UI-only modules (like UI themes) with its own localization and settings.
* Working on more examples and guides.

The planned release data for v5.1 is **February, 2022**. See the [5.1 milestone](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/milestone/60) on GitHub for all the issues we are working on.

## Backlog Items

The *Next Versions* section above shows the main focus of the planned versions. However, in each release we add new features to the core framework and the [application modules](Modules/Index.md).
