# ABP Framework Road Map

This document provides a road map, release schedule, and planned features for the ABP Framework.

## Next Versions

### v8.3

The next version will be 8.3 and planned to release the stable 8.3 version in August 2024. We will be mostly working on the following topics:

* Angular Universal ([#15782](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/issues/15782))
* Angular generate-proxy root namespace options ([#18932](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/issues/18932))
* Blazor global JS & CSS at runtime ([#19963](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/issues/19963))
* CMS Kit - Improvement in editing approval system for comments ([#19976](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/issues/19976))
* Improvements on the existing features and provide more guides.

See the [8.3 milestone](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/milestone/101) for all the issues we've planned to work on.
