# ABP Framework Road Map

This document provides a road map, release schedule and planned features for the ABP Framework.

## Next Versions

### v5.4

In [5.4 milestone](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/milestone/67), we will be mostly working on the following topics:

* Providing an OpenIddict integration to replace current IdentityServer4 integration.
* Maturing and documenting the [eShopOnAbp](https://github.com/abpframework/eShopOnAbp) project, writing a free e-book that explains the solution.
* Working on the [LeptonX](https://blog.abp.io/abp/LeptonX-Theme-for-ABP-Framework-Alpha-Release) theme and making it as the default theme for the ABP Framework UI options.
* Improvements on the existing features and providing more guides.

The planned release date for v5.4 is **July, 2022**.

> After the version 5.4, we will be working for 6.0 which will be released in the end of 2022 based on .NET 7.0.
