# ABP Framework Road Map

You can always check the milestone planning and the prioritized backlog issues on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/milestones) for a detailed road map.

While we will **continue to add other exciting features**, we will work on the following major items in the **middle term**:

* **Blazor UI** for the framework and all the pre-built modules.
* **.NET 5.0**! As Microsoft has announced that the .NET 5.0 will be released in November 2020, we will prepare for this change before and move to the .NET 5.0 just after Microsoft releases it. We hope a smooth transition.

Beside this middle term goals, there are many features in the [backlog](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/milestone/2). Here, a list of some major items in the backlog;
