# ABP Documentation

ABP is an **open source application framework** focused on ASP.NET Core based web application development, but also supports developing other types of applications.

Explore the left navigation menu to deep dive in the documentation.

## Project Status

ABP is the **next generation** of the open source [ASP.NET Boilerplate](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/) framework. It's currently in preview stage and not ready to use in production. The documentation is still in progress and it is far from complete.

For short-term and production level applications, it's suggested to use [ASP.NET Boilerplate](https://aspnetboilerplate.com/) framework which has rich feature set, mature, actively maintained and up-to-date.

## Getting Started

Easiest way to start a new project with ABP is to use the startup templates:

* [ASP.NET Core MVC (Razor Pages) UI Template](Getting-Started-AspNetCore-MVC-Template.md)
* [Angular UI Template](Getting-Started-Angular-Template.md)

If you want to start from scratch (with an empty project) then manually install the ABP Framework and use the following tutorials:

* [Console Application](Getting-Started-Console-Application.md)
* [ASP.NET Core Web Application](Getting-Started-AspNetCore-Application.md)

## Source Code

ABP is hosted on GitHub. See [the source code](https://github.com/abpframework/abp).

## Want to Contribute?

ABP is a community-driven open source project. See [the contribution guide](Contribution/Index.md) if you want to be a part of this project.
