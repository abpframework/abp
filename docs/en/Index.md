# ABP Documentation

ABP is an **open source application framework** focused on ASP.NET Core based web application development, but also supports developing other types of applications.

Explore the left navigation menu to deep dive in the documentation.

## Getting Started

Easiest way to start a new project with ABP is to use the startup templates:

* [ASP.NET Core MVC (Razor Pages) UI Startup Template](Getting-Started-AspNetCore-MVC-Template.md)
* [Angular UI Startup Template](Getting-Started-Angular-Template.md)

If you want to start from scratch (with an empty project) then manually install the ABP Framework and use the following tutorials:

* [Console Application](Getting-Started-Console-Application.md)
* [ASP.NET Core Web Application](Getting-Started-AspNetCore-Application.md)

## Source Code
