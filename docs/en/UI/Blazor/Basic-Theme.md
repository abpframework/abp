# Blazor UI: Basic Theme

````

The Basic Theme is a theme implementation for the Blazor UI. It is a minimalist theme that doesn't add any styling on top of the plain [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). You can take the Basic Theme as the **base theme** and build your own theme or styling on top of it. See the *Customization* section.

> If you are looking for a professional, enterprise ready theme, you can check the [Lepton Theme](https://commercial.abp.io/themes), which is a part of the [ABP Commercial](https://commercial.abp.io/).

> See the [Theming document](Theming.md) to learn about themes.

    builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#ApplicationContainer");
    ```
    `#ApplicationContainer` is a selector (like `<div id="ApplicationContainer">Loading...</div>`) in the `index.html`.

## Customization

You have two options two customize this theme:

### Overriding Styles / Components

In this approach, you continue to use the theme as NuGet and NPM packages and customize the parts you need to. There are several ways to customize it;

#### Override the Styles

You can simply override the styles in the Global Styles file of your application.

#### Override the Components

See the [Customization / Overriding Components](Customization-Overriding-Components.md) to learn how you can replace components, customize and extend the user interface.

### Copy & Customize

You can run the following [ABP CLI](../../CLI.md) command in **Blazor{{if UI == "Blazor"}}WebAssembly{{else}} Server{{end}}** project directory to copy the source code to your solution:

{{if UI == "Blazor"}}

`abp add-package Volo.Abp.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.BasicTheme --with-source-code --add-to-solution-file`

Then, navigate to downloaded `Volo.Abp.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.BasicTheme` project directory and run:

`abp add-package Volo.Abp.AspNetCore.Components.Web.BasicTheme --with-source-code --add-to-solution-file`

{{end}}

{{if UI == "BlazorServer"}}

`abp add-package Volo.Abp.AspNetCore.Components.Server.BasicTheme --with-source-code --add-to-solution-file`

Then, navigate to downloaded `Volo.Abp.AspNetCore.Components.Server.BasicTheme` project directory and run:

`abp add-package Volo.Abp.AspNetCore.Components.Web.BasicTheme --with-source-code --add-to-solution-file`

{{end}}

Or, you can download the source code of the Basic Theme, manually copy the project content into your solution, re-arrange the package/module dependencies (see the Installation section above to understand how it was installed to the project) and freely customize the theme based on your application requirements.
