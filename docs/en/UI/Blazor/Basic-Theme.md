# Blazor UI: Basic Theme

The Basic Theme is a theme implementation for the Blazor UI. It is a minimalist theme that doesn't add any styling on top of the plain [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). You can take the Basic Theme as the **base theme** and build your own theme or styling on top of it. See the *Customization* section.

> If you are looking for a professional, enterprise ready theme, you can check the [Lepton Theme](https://commercial.abp.io/themes), which is a part of the [ABP Commercial](https://commercial.abp.io/).

> See the [Theming document](Theming.md) to learn about themes.

## Installation

**This theme is already installed** when you create a new solution using the [startup templates](../../Startup-Templates/Index.md). If you need to manually install it, follow the steps below:

* Install the [Volo.Abp.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.BasicTheme](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Volo.Abp.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.BasicTheme) NuGet package to your web project.
* Add `AbpAspNetCoreComponentsWebAssemblyBasicThemeModule` into the `[DependsOn(...)]` attribute for your [module class](../../Module-Development-Basics.md) in the your Blazor UI project.
* Use `Volo.Abp.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.BasicTheme.Themes.Basic.App` as the root component of your application in the `ConfigureServices` method of your module:

````csharp
var builder = context.Services.GetSingletonInstance<WebAssemblyHostBuilder>();
builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#ApplicationContainer");
````

`#ApplicationContainer` is a selector (like `<div id="ApplicationContainer">Loading...</div>`) in the `index.html`.
