# ASP.NET Core MVC / Razor Pages: Page Header

`IPageLayout` service can be used to set the page title, selected menu item and the breadcrumb items for a page. It's the [theme](Theming.md)'s responsibility to render these on the page.

## IPageLayout

`IPageLayout` can be injected in any page/view to set the page header properties.

### Page Title

Page Title can be set as shown in the example below:

````csharp
@inject IPageLayout PageLayout
@{
    PageLayout.Content.Title = "Book List";
}
````

* The Page Title is set to the HTML `title` tag (in addition to the [brand/application name](Branding.md)).
* The theme may render the Page Title before the Page Content (not implemented by the Basic Theme).

### Breadcrumb

> **The [Basic Theme](Basic-Theme.md) currently doesn't implement the breadcrumbs.**
> 
> The [LeptonX Lite Theme](../../Themes/LeptonXLite/AspNetCore.md) supports breadcrumbs.

Breadcrumb items can be added to the `PageLayout.Content.BreadCrumb`.

**Example: Add Language Management to the breadcrumb items.**

````
PageLayout.Content.BreadCrumb.Add("Language Management");
````

The theme then renders the breadcrumb. An example render result can be:

![breadcrumbs-example](../../images/breadcrumbs-example.png)

* The Home icon is rendered by default. Set `PageLayout.Content.BreadCrumb.ShowHome` to `false` to hide it.
* Current Page name (got from the `PageLayout.Content.Title`) is added as the last by default. Set `PageLayout.Content.BreadCrumb.ShowCurrent` to `false` to hide it.

Any item that you add is inserted between Home and Current Page items. You can add as many item as you need. `BreadCrumb.Add(...)` method gets three parameters:

* `text`: The text to show for the breadcrumb item.
* `url` (optional): A URL to navigate to, if the user clicks to the breadcrumb item.
* `icon` (optional): An icon class (like `fas fa-user-tie` for Font-Awesome) to show with the `text`.

### The Selected Menu Item

> **The [Basic Theme](Basic-Theme.md) currently doesn't implement the selected menu item since it is not applicable to the top menu which is the only option for the Basic Theme for now.**
>
> The [LeptonX Lite Theme](../../Themes/LeptonXLite/AspNetCore.md) supports selected menu item.

You can set the Menu Item name related to this page:

```csharp
PageLayout.Content.MenuItemName = "BookStore.Books";
```

Menu item name should match a unique menu item name defined using the [Navigation / Menu](Navigation-Menu.md) system. In this case, it is expected from the theme to make the menu item "active" in the main menu.
