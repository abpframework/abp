# ASP.NET Core MVC / Razor Pages: The Basic Theme

The Basic Theme is a theme implementation for the ASP.NET Core MVC / Razor Pages UI. It is a minimalist theme that doesn't add any styling on top of the plain [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). You can take the Basic Theme as the **base theme** and build your own theme or styling on top of it. See the *Customization* section.

The Basic Theme has RTL (Right-to-Left language) support.

> If you are looking for a professional, enterprise ready theme, you can check the [Lepton Theme](https://commercial.abp.io/themes), which is a part of the [ABP Commercial](https://commercial.abp.io/).

### Overriding Styles/Components

In this approach, you continue to use the the theme as NuGet and NPM packages and customize the parts you need to. There are several ways to customize it;

#### Override the Styles

1. Create a CSS file in the `wwwroot` folder of your project:

![example-global-styles](../../images/example-global-styles.png)

2. Add the style file to the global bundle, in the `ConfigureServices` method of your [module](../../Module-Development-Basics.md):

````csharp
Configure<AbpBundlingOptions>(options =>
{
    options.StyleBundles.Configure(BasicThemeBundles.Styles.Global, bundle =>
    {
        bundle.AddFiles("/styles/global-styles.css");
    });
});
````

#### Override the Components

See the [User Interface Customization Guide](Customization-User-Interface.md) to learn how you can replace components, customize and extend the user interface.

### Copy & Customize

You can download the [source code](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/tree/dev/framework/src/Volo.Abp.AspNetCore.Mvc.UI.Theme.Basic) of the Basic Theme, copy the project content into your solution, re-arrange the package/module dependencies (see the Installation section above to understand how it was installed to the project) and freely customize the theme based on your application requirements.
