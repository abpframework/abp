# ABP Tag Helpers

ABP Framework defines a set of **tag helper components** to simply the user interface development for ASP.NET Core (MVC / Razor Pages) applications.

## Bootstrap Component Wrappers

Most of the tag helpers are [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (v4+) wrappers. Coding bootstrap is not so easy, not so type-safe and contains too much repetitive HTML tags. ABP Tag Helpers makes it **easier** and **type safe**.

We don't aim to wrap bootstrap components 100%. Writing **native bootstrap style code** is still possible (actually, tag helpers generates native bootstrap code in the end), but we suggest to use the tag helpers wherever possible.

ABP Framework also adds some **useful features** to the standard bootstrap components.

Here, the list of components those are wrapped by the ABP Framework:

* [Buttons](Buttons.md)
* ...
