# CrossOriginStrategy

`CrossOriginStrategy` is a class exposed by @abp/ng.core package. Its instances define how a source referenced by an element will be retrieved by the browser and are consumed by other classes such as `LoadingStrategy`.


## API

```js
constructor(
  public crossorigin: 'anonymous' | 'use-credentials',
