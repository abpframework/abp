# CMS Kit: Blogging

The blogging feature provides the necessary UI to manage and render blogs and blog posts.

## Enabling the Blogging Feature

By default, CMS Kit features are disabled. Therefore, you need to enable the features you want, before starting to use it. You can use the [Global Feature](../../Global-Features.md) system to enable/disable CMS Kit features on development time. Alternatively, you can use the ABP Framework's [Feature System](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Features) to disable a CMS Kit feature on runtime.

> Check the ["How to Install" section of the CMS Kit Module documentation](Index.md#how-to-install) to see how to enable/disable CMS Kit features on development time.

## User Interface

The following menu items are added by the blogging feature to the admin application:

**Slug** is the URL part of the blog. For this example, the root URL of the blog becomes `your-domain.com/blogs/technical-blog/`.

- You can change the default slug by using `CmsBlogsWebConsts.BlogRoutePrefix` constant. For example, if you set it to `foo`, the root URL of the blog becomes `your-domain.com/foo/technical-blog/`.

    ```csharp
    public override void PreConfigureServices(ServiceConfigurationContext context)
    {
        CmsBlogsWebConsts.BlogsRoutePrefix = "foo";
    }
    ```
