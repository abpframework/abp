# Comment System

CMS kit provides a **comment** system to add comments feature to any kind of resource, like blog posts, products, etc. This section describes the details of the comments system.

## Feature

CMS kit uses the [global feature](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Global-Features) system for all implemented features. Commercial startup templates come with all the CMS kit related features are enabled by default, if you create the solution with public website option. If you're installing the CMS kit manually or want to enable the comment feature individually, open the `GlobalFeatureConfigurator` class in the `Domain.Shared` project and place the following code to the `Configure ` method.

```csharp
GlobalFeatureManager.Instance.Modules.CmsKit(cmsKit =>
{
    cmsKit.Comments.Enable();
});
```

# Options

## CmsKitCommentOptions

You can use the comment system to add comments to any kind of resources, like blog posts, products etc. Comment system provides a mechanism to group comment definitions by entity types. For example, if you want to use comment system for blog posts and products, you need to define two entity types named `BlogPosts` and `Product`, and add comments under these entity types.

`CmsKitCommentOptions` can be configured in the domain layer, in the `ConfigureServices` method of your [module](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Module-Development-Basics). Example:

```csharp
Configure<CmsKitCommentOptions>(options =>
{
    options.EntityTypes.Add(new CommentEntityTypeDefinition("Product"));
});
```

> If you're using the blog feature, the ABP framework defines an entity type for the blog feature automatically. You can easily override or remove the predefined entity types in `Configure` method like shown above.

`CmsKitCommentOptions` properties:

- `EntityTypes`: List of defined entity types(`CmsKitCommentOptions`) in the comment system.

`CommentEntityTypeDefinition` properties:

- `EntityType`: Name of the entity type.

# Internals

## Domain Layer

#### Aggregates

This module follows the [Entity Best Practices & Conventions](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Best-Practices/Entities) guide.

##### Comment

A comment represents a written comment from a user.

- `Comment` (aggregate root): Represents a written comment in the system.

#### Repositories

This module follows the [Repository Best Practices & Conventions](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Best-Practices/Repositories) guide.

Following custom repositories are defined for this feature:

- `ICommentRepository`

#### Domain services

This module follows the [Domain Services Best Practices & Conventions](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Best-Practices/Domain-Services) guide.

##### Comment Manager

`CommentManager` is used to perform some operations for the `Comment` aggregate root.

### Application layer

#### Application services

- `CommentAdminAppService` (implements `ICommentAdminAppService`): Implements the use cases of comment management system, like listing or removing comments etc.
- `CommentPublicAppService` (implements `ICommentPublicAppService`):  Implements the use cases of comment management on the public websites, like listing comments, adding comments etc.

### Database providers

#### Common

##### Table / collection prefix & schema

All tables/collections use the `Cms` prefix by default. Set static properties on the `CmsKitDbProperties` class if you need to change the table prefix or set a schema name (if supported by your database provider).

##### Connection string

This module uses `CmsKit` for the connection string name. If you don't define a connection string with this name, it fallbacks to the `Default` connection string.

See the [connection strings](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Connection-Strings) documentation for details.

#### Entity Framework Core

##### Tables

- CmsComments

#### MongoDB

##### Collections

- **CmsComments**

### MVC UI

The comment system provides a commenting widget to allow users to send comments to resources on public websites. You can simply place the widget on a page like below. 

```csharp
@await Component.InvokeAsync(typeof(CommentingViewComponent), new
{
  entityType = "entityType",
  entityId = "entityId"
})
```
You need to specify entity type and entity ID parameters. Entity type represents the group name you specified while defining the comments in the domain module. Entity ID represents the unique identifier for the resource that users send comments to, such as blog post ID or product ID.

For more information about widgets see [widgets](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/UI/AspNetCore/Widgets) documentation.
