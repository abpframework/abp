# Audit Logging Module

The Audit Logging Module basically implements the `IAuditingStore` to save the audit log objects to a database.

> Audit Logging module is already installed and configured for [the startup templates](../Startup-Templates/Index.md). So, most of the times you don't need to manually add this module to your application.

See [the audit logging system](../Audit-Logging.md) document for more about the audit logging.
