    cmsKit.EnableAll();

## Packages

This module follows the [module development best practices guide](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Best-Practices/Index) and consists of several NuGet and NPM packages. See the guide if you want to understand the packages and relations between them.

CMS kit packages are designed for various usage scenarios. When you visit the [CMS kit package list page](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Volo.CmsKit), you will see that packages have admin, public and unified versions. 
For example,
 - `Volo.CmsKit.Admin.Application`: Contains functionality required by admin websites.
 - `Volo.CmsKit.Public.Application`: Contains functionality required by public websites.
 - `Volo.CmsKit.Application` : Unified package dependent on both public and admin packages.

If you want to separate admin and public website codes, you can use the admin and public packages. However, if you want to keep admin and public website codes in a shared project, you can use the unified packages to include admin and public packages. 

It is recommended to use the unified packages instead of adding both admin and public packages.

## Feature System

CMS kit uses the [global feature](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Global-Features) system for all implemented features. You can use the global feature system to enable all features or only enabled specific features easily.

To enable all features in the CMS kit, open the `GlobalFeatureConfigurator` class in the `Domain.Shared` project.

```csharp
GlobalFeatureManager.Instance.Modules.CmsKit(cmsKit =>
{
    cmsKit.EnableAll();
});
```

You can only enable specific features such as pages, like below.

```csharp
GlobalFeatureManager.Instance.Modules.CmsKit(cmsKit =>
{
    cmsKit.Pages.Enable();
});
```
