# ABP Version 7.4 Migration Guide

This document is a guide for upgrading ABP v7.3 solutions to ABP v7.4. There are a few changes in this version that may affect your applications, please read it carefully and apply the necessary changes to your application.

## Bumped the `Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.Embedded` Package Version To v7.0.10

In this version, the `Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.Embedded` (and other `Microsoft.*` packages) upgraded to the latest version, which is v7.0.10. Therefore, in your solution, you should update the `Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.Embedded` package (and other `Microsoft.*` packages) version to v7.0.10. This package typically would be in your `Domain.Shared` project and other projects that have embedded resource(s). So, search this package through your solution and update it accordingly.

> You can check [this issue](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/pull/17516) to see the updated package versions.

## Renamed the `AddGlobalFilters<>` method as `FilterQueryable<>` in `IMongoDbRepositoryFilterer`

ABP Framework provides services to automatically filter data on querying from a database. Prior to this version, creating a new class that derives from the `MongoDbRepositoryFilterer` and overriding its `AddGlobalFilters` method was needed for implementing a data filter for [MongoDB](../MongoDB.md).

In this version, the `AddGlobalFilters<>` method is renamed as `FilterQueryable<>`. Therefore, you need to update the method name if you have used data filtering for MongoDB, in your application.

## Exposing Integration Services

[Integration Services](../Integration-Services.md) are now not being exposed by default. In a monolith application, integration services don't need to be exposed outside since the modules would probably be in-process communication with each other. Therefore, they don't need to be exposed for most of the time.

If you build a microservice solution or you need to access an integration service via a network call from any other application, you will probably need to expose the integration services so the other applications can consume them.

To expose integration services and controllers, you can configure the `AbpAspNetCoreMvcOptions` and set the `ExposeIntegrationServices` property as *true* in the `ConfigureServices` method of your [module class](../Module-Development-Basics.md):

```csharp
Configure<AbpAspNetCoreMvcOptions>(options =>
{
    options.ExposeIntegrationServices = true;
});
```

## `LocalizationResource` property removed from the `TemplateDefinition` class

In this version, the `LocalizationResource` property was removed from the `TemplateDefinition` class and instead, the `LocalizationResourceName` property has been added.

```diff
-    public Type LocalizationResource { get; set; }
+    public string LocalizationResourceName { get; set; }
```

## Changed the method signature for `ICorrelationIdProvider.Get()`

Prior to this version, the `ICorrelationIdProvider.Get()` method used to return a non nullable string that represented a *correlationId* (a unique key that is used in distributed applications to trace requests across multiple services/operations). In this version, this method may return `null` if it hasn't been generated by `AbpCorrelationIdMiddleware` before.

```diff
public interface ICorrelationIdProvider
{
    
-    [NotNull] string Get();
+    string? Get();

    //other methods

}
```

Therefore, if you've used this method in your application, you might want to make a null check and update the method signature where it's used.

## Dynamic Setting Store - Setting Management Module

In this version, ABP Framework introduces Dynamic Setting Store, which is an important feature that allows us to collect and get all setting definitions from a single point. This feature requires some actions that need to be taken care of as the following:

*  You need to create a new migration and apply it to your database because a new database table has been added.
* `ISettingDefinitionManager`'s sync methods have been removed and instead, asynchronous versions of the existing methods have been added.

```diff
public interface ISettingDefinitionManager
{
-  SettingDefinition Get([NotNull] string name);
+  Task<SettingDefinition> GetAsync([NotNull] string name);

-  IReadOnlyList<SettingDefinition> GetAll();
+  Task<IReadOnlyList<SettingDefinition>> GetAllAsync();

-   SettingDefinition? GetOrNull(string name);
+   Task<SettingDefinition?> GetOrNullAsync([NotNull] string name);
}
```

## `IdentityUserIntegrationService` - Identity Module

In this version, ABP Framework introduces the `IdentityUserIntegrationService`, which is designed to get the current user's information, such as his/her role names within a non-authorized integration service. 

> For more information, see the related PR: [#16962](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/pull/16962)

This is a breaking change for microservice solutions because of the following two reasons and it should be considered:

* `IdentityUserIntegrationService` provides non-authorized services. This is not breaking the application but should be taken care of. Since, everyone can use the service to retrieve some information for a certain user (for example, the role names of a user).
* Secondly, since integration services are not exposed by default anymore as explained in the *Exposing Integration Services* section above, you should explicitly enable exposing integration services. Otherwise, the operation will fail and you'll get a `404` error from the identity microservice.

To expose integration services and controllers, you can configure the `AbpAspNetCoreMvcOptions` and set the `ExposeIntegrationServices` property as *true* in the `ConfigureServices` method of your [module class](../Module-Development-Basics.md):

```csharp
Configure<AbpAspNetCoreMvcOptions>(options =>
{
    options.ExposeIntegrationServices = true;
});
```

## Blazor UI
If you use Blazor WASM or Blazor Server UI, you should follow this section.

### Bumped the `Blazorise` dependencies to `1.3.1`
In this version, the `Blazorise` dependencies are upgraded to the `1.3.1` version. you should upgrade Blazorise packages to `1.3.1` in your `Blazor.csproj` file.
The following packages are included in the templates by default:
- `Blazorise.Bootstrap5`
- `Blazorise.Icons.FontAwesome`
- `Blazorise.Components`
> _If your project depends on more blazorise packages, then you should upgrade all of them._
> You should execute `dotnet build` & `abp bundle` commands in the Blazor project if you are using the Blazor WebAssembly.

### Bumped the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.*` dependency to `7.0.10`

In this version, the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.*` dependencies are upgraded to the `7.0.10` version. Therefore, you should upgrade the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly` packages to `7.0.10` in your `Blazor.csproj` file.

## Angular UI
We would like to inform you that ABP Framework version 7.4 uses Angular version 16. Please migrate your applications to Angular 16. [Update angular](https://update.angular.io/)
