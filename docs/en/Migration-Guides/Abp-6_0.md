# ABP Version 6.0 Migration Guide

This document is a guide for upgrading ABP v5.3 solutions to ABP v6.0. There is a change in this version that may affect your applications, please read it carefully and apply the necessary changes to your application.

## Added IsActive property

`IsActive` property is added to `IUserData`. This property is set to **true** by default. **Cmskit** and **Blog** modules are affected by this change. You need to add new migration to your existing application if you are using any of these modules. Please see [#11417](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/pull/11417) for more info.

## Default behavior change in MultiTenancyMiddlewareErrorPageBuilder

If you have customized the `MultiTenancyMiddlewareErrorPageBuilder` of `AbpMultiTenancyOptions`, the pipeline now returns **true** to stop the pipeline as the default behavior. See [AbpMultiTenancyOptions: Handle inactive and non-existent tenants](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/blob/dev/docs/en/Multi-Tenancy.md#abpmultitenancyoptions-handle-inactive-and-non-existent-tenants) for more info.
