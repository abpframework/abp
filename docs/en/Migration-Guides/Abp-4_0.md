# ABP Framework 3.3 to 4.0 Migration Guide

## Auto API Controller Route Changes

The route calculation for the [Auto API Controllers](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/API/Auto-API-Controllers) is changing with the ABP Framework version 4.0 ([#5325](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/issues/5325)). Previously, **camelCase** route paths were being used. Beginning from the version 4.0, it uses **kebab-case** route paths where it is possible.

**camelCase route parts become kebab-case with 4.0**

If it is hard to change it for your application, you can continue to use the version 3.x route strategy, by following one of the approaches;

- Set `UseV3UrlStyle` to `true` in the options of the `options.ConventionalControllers.Create(...)` method. Example:

```csharp
options.ConventionalControllers
    .Create(typeof(BookStoreApplicationModule).Assembly, opts =>
        {
            opts.UseV3UrlStyle = true;
        });
```

This approach effects only the controllers for the `BookStoreApplicationModule`.

- Set `UseV3UrlStyle` to `true` for the `AbpConventionalControllerOptions` to set it globally. Example:

```csharp
Configure<AbpConventionalControllerOptions>(options =>
{
    options.UseV3UrlStyle = true;
});
```

Setting it globally effects all the modules in a modular application.

## Identity Server Changes

ABP Framework upgrades the [IdentityServer4](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IdentityServer4) library from 3.x to 4.x with the ABP Framework version 4.0. IdentityServer 4.x has a lot of changes, some of them are **breaking changes in the data structure**.

### Entity Changes

Entity changed don't directly affect your application, however it is good to know.

#### ApiScope

As the **most important breaking change**, Identity Server 4.x places the `ApiScope` as an independent aggregate root. Previously it was a part of the to `ApiResource` aggregate. This requires manual operation. See the _Database Changes_ section.

Also, added `Enabled(string)` and `Description(bool,true)` properties.

#### ApiResource

- Added `AllowedAccessTokenSigningAlgorithms (string)` and `ShowInDiscoveryDocument(bool, default: true)` properties

#### Client

- Added `RequireRequestObject (bool)` and `AllowedIdentityTokenSigningAlgorithms (string)` properties.
- Changed default value of `RequireConsent` from `true` to `false`.
- Changed default value of `RequirePkce` from `false` to `true`.

#### DeviceFlowCodes

- Added `SessionId (string)` and `Description (string)` properties.

#### PersistedGrant

- Added `SessionId (string)` and `Description(string)` and `ConsumedTime (DateTime?)` properties

### Database Changes

> Attention: **Please backup your database** before the migration!

**If you are upgrading from 3.x, then there are some change should be done in your database.**

#### Database Schema Migration

If you are using **Entity Framework Core**, you need to add a new database migration, using the `Add-Migration` command, and apply changes to the database. Please **review the migration** script and read the sections below to understand if it affects your existing data. Otherwise, you may **loose some of your configuration**, which may not be easy to remember and re-configure.

#### Seed Code

If you haven't customize the `IdentityServerDataSeedContributor` and haven't customized the initial data inside the `IdentityServer*` tables;

1. Update `IdentityServerDataSeedContributor` class by comparing to [the latest code](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/blob/dev/templates/app/aspnet-core/src/MyCompanyName.MyProjectName.Domain/IdentityServer/IdentityServerDataSeedContributor.cs). You probably only need to add the `CreateApiScopesAsync` method and the code related to it.
2. Then you can simply clear all the **table data** in these tables then execute the `DbMigrator` application again to fill it with the new configuration.

#### Migrating the Configuration Data

If you've customize your IdentityServer configuration in the database or in the seed data, you should understand the changes and upgrade your code/data accordingly. Especially, the following changes will affect your application:

- `IdentityServerApiScopes` table's `Enabled` field is dropped and re-created. So, you need to manually enable the api scopes again.
- `IdentityServerApiResourceScopes` table is dropped and recreated. So, you need to backup and move your current data to the new table.
- `IdentityServerIdentityResourceClaims` table is dropped and recreated. So, you need to backup and move your current data to the new table.

You may need to perform additional steps based on how much you made custom configurations.

### Other IdentityServer Changes

IdentityServer has removed the [public origin option](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4/pull/4335). It was resolving http/https conversion problems, but they decided to leave this to the developer. This is especially needed if you use a reverse proxy where your external protocol is HTTPS but internal protocol is HTTP.

One simple solution is to add such a middleware into your ASP.NET Core pipeline, at the beginning.

```csharp
app.Use((httpContext, next) =>
{
    httpContext.Request.Scheme = "https";
    return next();
});
```

> This sample is obtained from the [ASP.NET Core documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/proxy-load-balancer#scenarios-and-use-cases). You can use it if you always use HTTPS in all environments.

## Blazor UI

### AbpCrudPageBase Changes

- `OpenEditModalAsync` method is requires `EntityDto` instead of id (`Guid`) parameter.
- `DeleteEntityAsync` method doesn't display confirmation dialog anymore. You can use the new `EntityActions` component in DataGrids to show confirmation messages. You can also inject `IUiMessageService` to your page or component and call `ConfirmAsync` explicitly.
