# Nightly Builds

All framework & module packages are deployed to MyGet every night in weekdays. So, you can use or test the latest code without waiting the next release.

## Install & Uninstall Nightly Preview Packages

The latest version of nightly preview packages can be installed by the running below command in the root folder of application:

```bash
abp switch-to-nightly 
```

If you're using the ABP Framework nightly preview packages, you can switch back to stable version using this command:

```bash
abp switch-to-stable
```

See the [ABP CLI documentation](./CLI.md) for more information.
