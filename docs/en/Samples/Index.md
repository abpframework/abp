# Sample Applications

Here, a list of official samples built with the ABP Framework. Most of these samples are located under the [abpframework/abp-samples](https://github.com/abpframework/abp-samples) GitHub repository.

### Microservice Demo

A complete solution to demonstrate how to build systems based on the microservice architecture.

* [The complete documentation for this sample](Microservice-Demo.md)
* [Source code](https://github.com/abpframework/abp-samples/tree/master/MicroserviceDemo)
* [Microservice architecture document](../Microservice-Architecture.md)

### Book Store

A simple CRUD application to show basic principles of developing an application with the ABP Framework. The same sample was implemented with different technologies:

* **Book Store: Razor Pages UI & Entity Framework Core**

  * [Tutorial](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Tutorials/Part-1?UI=MVC)
  * [Source code](https://github.com/abpframework/abp-samples/tree/master/BookStore)

* **Book Store: Angular UI & MongoDB**

  * [Tutorial](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Tutorials/Part-1?UI=NG)
  * [Source code](https://github.com/abpframework/abp-samples/tree/master/BookStore-Angular-MongoDb)

* **Book Store: Modular application (Razor Pages UI & EF Core)**

  * [Source code](https://github.com/abpframework/abp-samples/tree/master/BookStore-Modular)

While there is no Razor Pages & MongoDB combination, you can check both documents to understand it since DB & UI selection don't effect each other.
