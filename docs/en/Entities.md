## Entities

Entities are one of the core concepts of DDD (Domain Driven Design). Eric Evans describe it as "*An object that is not fundamentally defined by its attributes, but rather by a thread of continuity and identity*".

An entity is generally mapped to a table in a relational database.

### Entity Class

Entities are derived from `Entity<TKey>` class as shown below:

```C#
public class Person : Entity<int>
{
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public DateTime CreationTime { get; set; }

    public Person()
    {
        CreationTime = DateTime.Now;
    }
}
```

> If you do not want to derive your entity from the base `Entity<TKey>` class, you can directly implement `IEntity<TKey>` interface.

`Entity<TKey>` class just defines an `Id` property with the given primary **key type**, which is `int` in the sample above. It can be other types like `string`, `Guid`, `long` or whatever you need.

Entity class also overrides the **equality** operator (==) to easily check if two entities are equal (they are equals if they are same entity type and their Ids are equals).

#### Entities with Composite Keys

Some entities may need to have **composite keys**. In that case, you can derive your entity from the non-generic `Entity` class. Example:

````C#
public class UserRole : Entity
{
    public Guid UserId { get; set; }

    public Guid RoleId { get; set; }
    
    public DateTime CreationTime { get; set; }

    public UserRole()
    {
            
    }
    
    public override object[] GetKeys()
    {
        return new object[] { UserId, RoleId };
    }
}
````

For the example above, the composite key is composed of `UserId` and `RoleId`. For a relational database, it is the composite primary key of the related table.

Entities with composite keys should implement the `GetKeys()` method as shown above.

Notice that you also need to define keys of the entity in your **object-relational mapping** (ORM) configuration.

> Also note that Entities with Composite Primary Keys cannot utilize the `IRepository<TEntity, TKey>` interface since it requires a single unique Id property.  However, you can always use `IRepository<TEntity>`. See [repositories documentation](Repositories.md) for more.


### AggregateRoot Class

"*Aggregate is a pattern in Domain-Driven Design. A DDD aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. An example may be an order and its line-items, these will be separate objects, but it's useful to treat the order (together with its line items) as a single aggregate.*" (see the [full description](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DDD_Aggregate.html))

`AggregateRoot` class extends the `Entity` class. So, it also has an `Id` property by default.

> Notice that ABP creates default repositories only for aggregate roots by default. However, it's possible to include all entities. See [repositories documentation](Repositories.md) for more. 

ABP does not force you to use aggregate roots, you can in fact use the `Entity` class as defined before. However, if you want to implement DDD and want to create aggregate root classes, there are some best practices you may want to consider:

* An aggregate root is responsible to preserve it's own integrity. This is also true for all entities, but aggregate root has responsibility for it's sub entities too. So, the aggregate root must always be in a valid state.
* An aggregate root can be referenced by it's Id. Do not reference it by it's navigation property.
* An aggregate root is treated as a single unit. It's retrieved and updated as a single unit. It's generally considered as a transaction boundary.
* Work with sub-entities over the aggregate root- do not modify them independently.

#### Aggregate Example

This is a full sample of an aggregate root with a related sub-entity collection:

````C#
public class Order : AggregateRoot<Guid>
{
    public virtual string ReferenceNo { get; protected set; }

    public virtual int TotalItemCount { get; protected set; }

    public virtual DateTime CreationTime { get; protected set; }

    public virtual List<OrderLine> OrderLines { get; protected set; }

    protected Order()
    {

    }

    public Order(Guid id, string referenceNo)
    {
        Check.NotNull(referenceNo, nameof(referenceNo));
        
        Id = id;
        ReferenceNo = referenceNo;
        
        OrderLines = new List<OrderLine>();
    }

    public void AddProduct(Guid productId, int count)
    {
        if (count <= 0)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException(
                "You can not add zero or negative count of products!",
                nameof(count)
            );
        }

        var existingLine = OrderLines.FirstOrDefault(ol => ol.ProductId == productId);

        if (existingLine == null)
        {
            OrderLines.Add(new OrderLine(this.Id, productId, count));
        }
        else
        {
            existingLine.ChangeCount(existingLine.Count + count);
        }

        TotalItemCount += count;
    }
}

public class OrderLine : Entity
{
    public virtual Guid OrderId { get; protected set; }

    public virtual Guid ProductId { get; protected set; }

    public virtual int Count { get; protected set; }

    protected OrderLine()
    {

    }

    internal OrderLine(Guid orderId, Guid productId, int count)
    {
        OrderId = orderId;
        ProductId = productId;
        Count = count;
    }

    internal void ChangeCount(int newCount)
    {
        Count = newCount;
    }
}
````

> If you do not want to derive your aggregate root from the base `AggregateRoot<TKey>` class, you can directly implement the `IAggregateRoot<TKey>` interface.

`Order` is an **aggregate root** with `Guid` type `Id` property. It has a collection of `OrderLine` entities. `OrderLine` is another entity with a composite primary key (`OrderId`  and ` ProductId`).

While this example may not implement all the best practices of an aggregate root, it still follows good practices:

* `Order` has a public constructor that takes **minimal requirements** to construct an `Order` instance. So, it's not possible to create an order without an id and reference number. The **protected/private** constructor is only necessary to **deserialize** the object while reading from a data source.
* `OrderLine` constructor is internal, so it is only allowed to be created by the domain layer. It's used inside of the `Order.AddProduct` method.
* `Order.AddProduct` implements the business rule to add a product to an order.
* All properties have `protected` setters. This is to prevent the entity from arbitrary changes from outside of the entity. For exmple, it would be dangerous to set `TotalItemCount` without adding a new product to the order. It's value is maintained by the `AddProduct` method.

ABP does not force you to apply any DDD rule or patterns. However, it tries to make it possible and easier when you do want to apply them. The documentation also follows the same principle.

#### Aggregate Roots with Composite Keys

While it's not common (and not suggested) for aggregate roots, it is in fact possible to define composite keys in the same way as defined for the mentioned entities above. Use non-generic `AggregateRoot` base class in that case.
