# Using Elsa Workflow with ABP Framework

**Elsa Core** is an open-source workflows library that can be used in any kind of .NET Core application. Using such a workflow library can be useful to implement business rules visually or programmatically.

![elsa-overview](./elsa-overview.gif)

This article shows how we can use this workflow library within our ABP-based application. We will start with a couple of examples and then we will integrate the **Elsa Dashboard** (you can see it in the above gif) into our application to be able to design our workflows visually.

## Source Code

You can find the source of the example solution used in this article [here](https://github.com/abpframework/abp-samples/tree/master/ElsaDemo).

## Create the Project

In this article, I will create a new startup template with EF Core as a database provider and MVC/Razor-Pages for the UI framework.

> If you already have a project with MVC/Razor-Pages or Blazor UI, you don't need to create a new startup template, you can directly implement the following steps to your existing project (you can skip this section).

* We will create a new solution named `ElsaDemo` (or whatever you want). We will create a new startup template with **EF Core** as a database provider and **MVC/Razor-Pages** for the UI framework by using the [ABP CLI](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/CLI):

```bash
abp new ElsaDemo
```

* Our project boilerplate will be ready after the download is finished. Then, we can open the solution in the Visual Studio (or any other IDE).

* We can run the `ElsaDemo.DbMigrator` project to apply migration into our database and seed initial data.

* After the database and initial data created, we can run the `ElsaDemo.Web` to see our UI working properly.

## Let's Create The First Workflow (Console Activity)

We can start with creating our first workflow. Let's get started with creating a basic hello-world workflow by using console activity. In this example, we will **programmatically** define a workflow definition that displays the text **"Hello World from Elsa!"** to the console using Elsa's Workflow Builder API and run this workflow when the application initialized.

### Install Packages

We need to add two packages: `Elsa` and `Elsa.Activities.Console` into our `ElsaDemo.Web` project. We can add these two packages with the following command:

```bash
dotnet add package Elsa
dotnet add package Elsa.Activities.Console
```

* After the packages installed, we can define our first workflow. To do this, create a folder named **Workflows** and in this folder create a class named `HelloWorldConsole`.

```csharp
using Elsa.Activities.Console;
using Elsa.Builders;

namespace ElsaDemo.Web.Workflows
{
    public class HelloWorldConsole : IWorkflow
    {
        public void Build(IWorkflowBuilder builder) => builder.WriteLine("Hello World from Elsa!");
    }
}
```

* In here we've basically implemented the `IWorkflow` interface which only has one method named **Build**. In this method, we can define our workflow's execution steps (activities).

* As you can see in the example above, we've used an activity named **WriteLine**, which writes a line of text to the console. Elsa Core has many pre-defined activities like that. E.g **HttpEndpoint** and **WriteHttpResponse** (we will see them both in the next section).

> "An activity is an atomic building block that represents a single executable step on the workflow." - [Elsa Core Activity Definition](https://elsa-workflows.github.io/elsa-core/docs/next/concepts/concepts-workflows#activity)

* After defining our workflow, we need to define service registrations which required for the Elsa Core library to work properly. To do that, open your `ElsaDemoWebModule` class and update your `ElsaDemoWebModule` with the following lines. Most of the codes are abbreviated for simplicity.

```csharp
using ElsaDemo.Web.Workflows;
using Elsa.Services;

public override void ConfigureServices(ServiceConfigurationContext context)
{
    var hostingEnvironment = context.Services.GetHostingEnvironment();
    var configuration = context.Services.GetConfiguration();

    //...

    ConfigureElsa(context);
}

private void ConfigureElsa(ServiceConfigurationContext context)
{
    context.Services.AddElsa(options =>
    {
        options
            .AddConsoleActivities()
            .AddWorkflow<HelloWorldConsole>();
    });
}

public override void OnApplicationInitialization(ApplicationInitializationContext context)
{
    //...

    var workflowRunner = context.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IBuildsAndStartsWorkflow>();
    workflowRunner.BuildAndStartWorkflowAsync<HelloWorldConsole>();
}
```

* Here we basically, configured Elsa's services in our `ConfigureServices` method and after that in our `OnApplicationInitialization` method we started the `HelloWorldConsole` workflow.

* If we run the application and examine the console outputs, we should see the message that we defined in our workflow.

![hello-world-workflow](./hello-world-workflow.jpg)

## Creating A Workflow By Using Http Activities

In this example, we will create a workflow that uses **Http Activities**. It will basically listen the specified route for incoming HTTP Request and writes back a simple response.

### Add Elsa.Activities.Http Package

* To be able to use **HTTP Activities** we need to add `Elsa` (we've already added in the previous section) and `Elsa.Activities.Http` packages into our web application.

```bash
dotnet add package Elsa.Activities.Http
```

* After the package installed, we can create our workflow. Let's started with creating a class named `HelloWorldHttp` under **Workflows** folder.

```csharp
using System.Net;
using Elsa.Activities.Http;
using Elsa.Builders;

namespace ElsaDemo.Web.Workflows
{
    public class HelloWorldHttp : IWorkflow
    {
        public void Build(IWorkflowBuilder builder)
        {
            builder
                .HttpEndpoint("/hello-world")
                .WriteHttpResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK, "<h1>Hello World!</h1>", "text/html");
        }
    }
}
```

* The above workflow has two activities. The first activity `HttpEndpoint` represents an HTTP endpoint, which can be invoked using an HTTP client, including a web browser. The first activity is connected to the second activity `WriteHttpResponse`, which returns a simple response to us.

* After defined the **HelloWorldHttp** workflow we need to define this class as workflow. So, open your `ElsaDemoWebModule` and update the `ConfigureElsa` method as below.

```csharp
private void ConfigureElsa(ServiceConfigurationContext context)
{
    context.Services.AddElsa(options =>
    {
        options
            .AddConsoleActivities()
            .AddHttpActivities() //add this line to be able to use the http activities
            .AddWorkflow<HelloWorldConsole>()
            .AddWorkflow<HelloWorldHttp>(); //workflow that we defined
    });
}
```
* And add the **UseHttpActivities** middleware to `OnApplicationInitilization` method of your `ElsaDemoWebModule` class.

```csharp
public override void OnApplicationInitialization(ApplicationInitializationContext context)
{
    // ...
    app.UseAuditing();
    app.UseAbpSerilogEnrichers();
    app.UseHttpActivities(); //add this line
    app.UseConfiguredEndpoints();

    var workflowRunner = context.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IBuildsAndStartsWorkflow>();
    workflowRunner.BuildAndStartWorkflowAsync<HelloWorldConsole>();
}
```

* If we run the application and navigate to the "/hello-world" route we should see the response message that we've defined (by using **WriteHttpResponse** activity) in our `HelloWorldHttp` workflow.

![hello-world-http](./hello-world-http.jpg)

## Integrate Elsa Dashboard To Application

* Until now we've created two workflows programmatically. But also we can create workflows visually by using Elsa's **HTML5 Workflow Designer**.

* Being able to design our workflows easily and taking advantage of **HTML5 Workflow Designer** we will integrate the Elsa Dashboard to our application. 

### Install Packages

* Following three packages required for Elsa Server.

```bash
dotnet add package Elsa.Activities.Temporal.Quartz
dotnet add package Elsa.Persistence.EntityFramework.SqlServer
dotnet add package Elsa.Server.Api
```

> Also, we need to install the **Elsa** and **Elsa.Activities.Http** packages but we've already installed these packages in the previous sections.

* We need to install one more package named `Elsa.Designer.Components.Web`. This package provides us the **Elsa Dashboard** component.

```bash
dotnet add package Elsa.Designer.Components.Web
```

* After the package installations completed, we need to make the necessary configurations to be able to use the **Elsa Server** and **Elsa Dashboard**. Therefore, open your `ElsaDemoWebModule` class and make the necessary changes as below.

```csharp
public override void ConfigureServices(ServiceConfigurationContext context)
{
    var configuration = context.Services.GetConfiguration();

    //...

    ConfigureElsa(context, configuration);
}

private void ConfigureElsa(ServiceConfigurationContext context, IConfiguration configuration)
{
    var elsaSection = configuration.GetSection("Elsa");

    context.Services.AddElsa(elsa =>
    {
        elsa
            .UseEntityFrameworkPersistence(ef =>
                DbContextOptionsBuilderExtensions.UseSqlServer(ef,
                    configuration.GetConnectionString("Default")))
            .AddConsoleActivities()
            .AddHttpActivities(elsaSection.GetSection("Server").Bind)
            .AddQuartzTemporalActivities()
            .AddJavaScriptActivities()
            .AddWorkflowsFrom<Startup>();
    });

    context.Services.AddElsaApiEndpoints();
    context.Services.Configure<ApiVersioningOptions>(options =>
    {
        options.UseApiBehavior = false;
    });

    context.Services.AddCors(cors => cors.AddDefaultPolicy(policy => policy
        .AllowAnyHeader()
        .AllowAnyMethod()
        .AllowAnyOrigin()
        .WithExposedHeaders("Content-Disposition"))
    );
    
    //register controllers inside elsa
    context.Services.AddAssemblyOf<Elsa.Server.Api.Endpoints.WorkflowRegistry.Get>();
    
    //Disable antiforgery validation for elsa
    Configure<AbpAntiForgeryOptions>(options =>
    {
        options.AutoValidateFilter = type =>
        	type.Assembly != typeof(Elsa.Server.Api.Endpoints.WorkflowRegistry.Get).Assembly;
    });
}

public override void OnApplicationInitialization(ApplicationInitializationContext context)
{
    app.UseCors();
    
    //...

    app.UseHttpActivities();
    app.UseConfiguredEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapFallbackToPage("/_Host");
    });

    var workflowRunner = context.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IBuildsAndStartsWorkflow>();
    workflowRunner.BuildAndStartWorkflowAsync<HelloWorldConsole>();
}
```

* In here we've specified the Elsa Server Api's assembly by using the `AddAssemblyOf<>` extension method to register the required services (controllers). These services required for the dashboard (if we create a workflow by using **Elsa Workflow Designer** it calls some services under the hook, therefore we need to be assured about these services get registered).

* With [v4.4](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/pull/9299), we will no longer need to specify this line of code.

> **Note:** `AddAssemblyOf<>` extension method can help you to register all your services by convention. You can check [here](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Dependency-Injection#conventional-registration) for more information about conventional registration.

* We don't need to register our workflows one by one anymore. Because now we use `.AddWorkflowsFrom<Startup>()`, and this registers workflows on our behalf. 

* As you may notice here, we use a section named `Elsa` and its sub-sections from the configuration system but we didn't define them yet. To define them open your `appsettings.json` and add the following Elsa section into this file.

```json
{
  //...
    
  "Elsa": {
    "Http": {
      "BaseUrl": "https://localhost:44336"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Define Permission For Elsa Dashboard

* We can define a [permission](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Authorization#permission-system) to be assured of only allowed users can see the Elsa Dashboard.

* Open your `ElsaDemoPermissions` class under the **Permissions** folder (in the `ElsaDemo.Application.Contracts` layer) and add the following permission name.

```csharp
namespace ElsaDemo.Permissions
{
    public static class ElsaDemoPermissions
    {
        public const string GroupName = "ElsaDemo";

        public const string ElsaDashboard = GroupName + ".ElsaDashboard";
    }
}
```

* After that, open your `ElsaDemoPermissionDefinitionProvider` class and define the permission for Elsa Dashboard.

```csharp
using ElsaDemo.Localization;
using Volo.Abp.Authorization.Permissions;
using Volo.Abp.Localization;

namespace ElsaDemo.Permissions
{
    public class ElsaDemoPermissionDefinitionProvider : PermissionDefinitionProvider
    {
        public override void Define(IPermissionDefinitionContext context)
        {
            var myGroup = context.AddGroup(ElsaDemoPermissions.GroupName);

            myGroup.AddPermission(ElsaDemoPermissions.ElsaDashboard, L("Permission:ElsaDashboard"));
        }

        private static LocalizableString L(string name)
        {
            return LocalizableString.Create<ElsaDemoResource>(name);
        }
    }
}
```

* As you can notice, we've used a localized value (**L("Permission:ElsaDashboard")**) but haven't added this localization key and value to the localization file, so let's add this localization key and value. To do this, open your `en.json` file under **Localization/ElsaDemo** folder (under the **DomainShared** layer) and add this localization key.

```json
{
  "culture": "en",
  "texts": {
    "Menu:Home": "Home",
    "Welcome": "Welcome",
    "LongWelcomeMessage": "Welcome to the application. This is a startup project based on the ABP framework. For more information, visit abp.io.",
    "Permission:ElsaDashboard": "Elsa Dashboard"
  }
}
```

#### Add Elsa Dashboard Component To Application

* After those configurations, now we can add Elsa Dashboard to our application with an authorization check. To do this, create a razor page named **_Host.cshtml** (under **Pages** folder) and update its content as below.

```html
@page "/elsa"
@using ElsaDemo.Permissions
@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization
@attribute [Authorize(ElsaDemoPermissions.ElsaDashboard)]
@{
    var serverUrl = $"{Request.Scheme}://{Request.Host}";
    Layout = null;
}

<elsa-studio-root server-url="@serverUrl" monaco-lib-path="_content/Elsa.Designer.Components.Web/monaco-editor/min"></elsa-studio-root>
</body>
</html>
```

* We've defined an attribute for authorization check here. With this authorization check, only the user who has the **Elsa Dashboard** permission allowed to see this page.

#### Add Elsa Dashboard Page To Main Menu

* We can open the `ElsaDemoMenuContributor` class under the **Menus** folder and define the menu item for reaching the Elsa Dashboard easily.

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using ElsaDemo.Localization;
using ElsaDemo.MultiTenancy;
using ElsaDemo.Permissions;
using Volo.Abp.Identity.Web.Navigation;
using Volo.Abp.SettingManagement.Web.Navigation;
using Volo.Abp.TenantManagement.Web.Navigation;
using Volo.Abp.UI.Navigation;

namespace ElsaDemo.Web.Menus
{
    public class ElsaDemoMenuContributor : IMenuContributor
    {
        public async Task ConfigureMenuAsync(MenuConfigurationContext context)
        {
            if (context.Menu.Name == StandardMenus.Main)
            {
                await ConfigureMainMenuAsync(context);
            }
        }

        private async Task ConfigureMainMenuAsync(MenuConfigurationContext context)
        {
            var administration = context.Menu.GetAdministration();
            var l = context.GetLocalizer<ElsaDemoResource>();

            context.Menu.Items.Insert(
                0,
                new ApplicationMenuItem(
                    ElsaDemoMenus.Home,
                    l["Menu:Home"],
                    "~/",
                    icon: "fas fa-home",
                    order: 0
                )
            );
            
            //add Workflow menu-item
            context.Menu.Items.Insert(
                1,
                new ApplicationMenuItem(
                    ElsaDemoMenus.Home,
                    "Workflow",
                    "~/elsa",
                    icon: "fas fa-code-branch",
                    order: 1,
                    requiredPermissionName: ElsaDemoPermissions.ElsaDashboard
                )
            );

            //...
        }
    }
}
```

* With that menu item configuration, only the user who has **Elsa Dashboard** permission allowed to see the defined menu item.

## Result

* Let's run the application and see how it looks like.

> If the account you are logged in has the **ElsaDemoPermissions.ElsaDashboard** permission, you should see the **Workflow** menu item. If you do not see this menu item, please be assured that your logged-in account has that permission.

* Now we can click the "Workflow" menu item, display the Elsa Dashboard and designing workflows.
