# Module Development Best Practices & Conventions

This document describes the **best practices** and **conventions** for those who want to develop **modules** that satisfy the following specifications:

* Develop modules that conform to the **Domain Driven Design** patterns & best practices.
* Develop modules with **DBMS and ORM independence**.
