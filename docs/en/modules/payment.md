# Payment Module (Pro)

> You must have an ABP Team or a higher license to use this module.

Payment module implements payment gateway integration of an application. It provides one time payment and recurring payment options. 

* Supports [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/), [2Checkout](https://www.2checkout.com/), [PayU](https://corporate.payu.com/), [Iyzico](https://www.iyzico.com/en) and [Alipay](https://global.alipay.com/) payment gateways.

See [the module description page](https://abp.io/modules/Volo.Payment) for an overview of the module features.

## How to install

Payment module is not installed in [the startup templates](../solution-templates/layered-web-application). So, it needs to be installed manually. There are two ways of installing a module into your application.


### Using ABP CLI

ABP CLI allows adding a module to a solution using ```add-module``` command. You can check its [documentation](../cli/index.md#add-module) for more information. So, payment module can be added using the command below;

```bash
abp add-module Volo.Payment
```

### Manual Installation

If you modified your solution structure, adding module using ABP CLI might not work for you. In such cases,  payment module can be added to a solution manually.

In order to do that, add packages listed below to matching project on your solution. For example, ```Volo.Payment.Application``` package to your **{ProjectName}.Application.csproj** like below;

```json
<PackageReference Include="Volo.Payment.Application" Version="x.x.x" />
```

After adding the package reference, open the module class of the project (eg: `{ProjectName}ApplicationModule`) and add the below code to the `DependsOn` attribute.

```csharp
[DependsOn(
  //...
  typeof(AbpPaymentApplicationModule)
)]
```

> If you are using Blazor Web App, you need to add the `Volo.Payment.Admin.Blazor.WebAssembly` package to the **{ProjectName}.Blazor.Client.csproj** project and ad the `Volo.Payment.Admin.Blazor.Server` package to the **{ProjectName}.Blazor.csproj** project.

### Supported Gateway Packages

In order to use a Payment Gateway, you need to add related NuGet packages to your related project as explained in Manual Installation section above and add ```DependsOn``` to your related module. For example, if you don't want to use PayU, you don't have to use its NuGet packages. 

After adding packages of a payment gateway to your application, you also need to configure global payment module options and options for the payment modules you have added. See the Options section below.

### Creating a custom payment gateway
If you require a different payment gateway than existing ones, you can create a custom payment gateway by your own. 2 steps are required to create a custom payment gateway. First is creating a payment gateway object that implements `IPaymentGateway`. This interface exposes core payment operations without any UI. Second step is creating UI for the payment gateway. This UI is used to redirect user to payment gateway and validate payment.

Follow the [instructions here](payment-custom-gateway) to create a custom payment gateway.

## Packages

This module follows the [module development best practices guide](../framework/architecture/best-practices) and consists of several NuGet and NPM packages. See the guide if you want to understand the packages and relations between them.

You can visit [Payment module package list page](https://abp.io/packages?moduleName=Volo.Payment) to see list of packages related with this module.

## User interface

### Public Pages

#### Payment gateway selection

This page allows selecting a payment gateway. If there is one payment gateway configured for final application, this page will be skipped.

![payment-gateway-selection](../images/payment-gateway-selection.png)

#### PayU prepayment page

This page is used to send Name, Surname and Email Address of user to PayU.

![payment-payu-prepayment-page](../images/payment-payu-prepayment-page.png)

### Admin Pages

### Angular UI

#### Installation

In order to configure the application to use the `PaymentModule`, you first need to import `PaymentAdminConfigModule` from `@volo/abp.ng.payment/admin/config` to the root module. `PaymentAdminConfigModule` has a static `forRoot` method which you should call for a proper configuration:

```js
// app.module.ts
import { PaymentAdminConfigModule } from '@volo/abp.ng.payment/admin/config';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // other imports
    PaymentAdminConfigModule.forRoot(),
    // other imports
  ],
  // ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

The `PaymentAdminModule` should be imported and lazy-loaded in your routing module as below:

```js
// app-routing.module.ts
const routes: Routes = [
  // other route definitions
  {
  path: 'payment',
  loadChildren: () =>
    import('@volo/abp.ng.payment/admin').then(m => m.PaymentAdminModule.forLazy()),
  },
];

@NgModule(/* AppRoutingModule metadata */)
export class AppRoutingModule {}
```

#### Payment plans page
Payment plans for subscriptions can be managed on this page. You can connect external subscriptions for each gateway to a plan.

![payment plans](../images/payment-plans.png)

![payment plans gateway plans](../images/payment-plans-gateway-plans.png)

#### Payment request list
This page lists all the payment request operations in application.

## Entity Extensions

[Module entity extension](../framework/architecture/modularity/extending/module-entity-extensions.md) system is a **high-level** extension system that allows you to **define new properties** for existing entities of the dependent modules. It automatically **adds properties to the entity**, **database**, **HTTP API and user interface** in a single point.

To extend entities of the payment module, open your `YourProjectNameModuleExtensionConfigurator` class inside of your `DomainShared` project and change the `ConfigureExtraProperties` method like shown below.

```csharp
public static void ConfigureExtraProperties()
{
    OneTimeRunner.Run(() =>
    {
        ObjectExtensionManager.Instance.Modules()
            .ConfigurePayment(payment =>
            {
                payment.ConfigurePlan(plan => // extend the Plan entity
                {
                    plan.AddOrUpdateProperty<string>( //property type: string
                      "PlanDescription", //property name
                      property => {
                        //validation rules
                        property.Attributes.Add(new RequiredAttribute()); //adds required attribute to the defined property

                        //...other configurations for this property
                      }
                    );
                });
              
              payment.ConfigureGatewayPlan(gatewayPlan => // extend the GatewayPlan entity
                {
                    gatewayPlan.AddOrUpdateProperty<string>( //property type: string
                      "GatewayPlanDescription", //property name
                      property => {
                        //validation rules
                        property.Attributes.Add(new RequiredAttribute()); //adds required attribute to the defined property
                        property.Attributes.Add(
                          new StringLengthAttribute(MyConsts.MaximumDescriptionLength) {
                            MinimumLength = MyConsts.MinimumDescriptionLength
                          }
                        );

                        //...other configurations for this property
                      }
                    );
                });     
            });
    });
}
```

* `ConfigurePayment(...)` method is used to configure the entities of the payment module.

* `payment.ConfigurePlan(...)` is used to configure the **Plan** entity of the payment module. You can add or update your extra properties of the
**Plan** entity. 

* `payment.ConfigureGatewayPlan(...)` is used to configure the **GatewayPlan** entity of the payment module. You can add or update your extra properties of the **GatewayPlan** entity. 

* You can also set some validation rules for the property that you defined. In the above sample, `RequiredAttribute` and `StringLengthAttribute` were added for the property named **"GatewayPlanDescription"**. 

* When you define the new property, it will automatically add to **Entity**, **HTTP API** and **UI** for you. 
  * Once you define a property, it appears in the create and update forms of the related entity. 
  * New properties also appear in the datatable of the related page.

## One-Time Payments

This module implements one-time payments;

* Supports [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/), [2Checkout](https://www.2checkout.com/), [PayU](https://corporate.payu.com/) and [Iyzico](https://www.iyzico.com/en) payment gateways.

You can get one-time payments from your customers using one or more payment gateways supported by the payment module. Payment module works in a very simple way for one-time payments. It creates a local payment request record and redirects customer to payment gateway (PayPal, Stripe etc...) for processing the payment. When the customer pays on the payment gateway, payment module handles the external payment gateway's response and validates the payment to see if it is really paid or not. If the payment is validated, payment module redirects customer to main application which initiated the payment process at the beginning.

Image below demonstrates the flow of a payment process;

![payment-module-flow](../images/payment-module-flow.png)

Each payment gateway implementation contains PrePayment and PostPayment pages. 

PrePayment page asks users for extra information if requested by the external payment gateway. For example, 2Checkout doesn't require any extra information, so PrePayment page for 2Checkout redirects user to 2Checkout without asking any extra information. 

PostPayment page is responsible for validation of the response of the external payment gateway. When a user completes the payment, user is redirected to PostPayment page for that payment gateway and PostPayment page validates the status of the payment. If the payment is succeeded, status of the payment request is updated and user is redirected to main application.

Note: It is main application's responsibility to handle if a payment request is used more than one time. For example if PostPayment page generates a URL like https://mywebsite.com/PaymentSucceed?PaymentRequestId={PaymentRequestId}, this URL can be visited more than onec manually by end users. If you already delivered your product for a given PaymentRequestId, you shouldn't deliver it when this URL is visited second time.

### Creating One-Time Payment

In order to initiate a payment process, inject `IPaymentRequestAppService`, create a payment request using it's `CreateAsync` method and redirect user to gateway selection page with the created payment request's Id. Here is a sample Razor Page code which starts a payment process on it's OnPost method.

> Redirection of the gateway selection page has to be a **POST** request. If you implement it as a **GET** request, you will get an error. You can use `LocalRedirectPreserveMethod` to keep the method as POST in the redirected request.

```c#
public class IndexModel: PageModel
{
    private readonly IPaymentRequestAppService _paymentRequestAppService;

    public IndexModel(IPaymentRequestAppService paymentRequestAppService)
    {
        _paymentRequestAppService = paymentRequestAppService;
    }

    public virtual async Task<IActionResult> OnPostAsync()
    {
        var paymentRequest = await _paymentRequestAppService.CreateAsync(new PaymentRequestCreateDto()
        {
            Currency= "USD",
            Products = new List<PaymentRequestProductCreateDto>()
            {
                new PaymentRequestProductCreateDto
                {
                    Code = "Product_01",
                    Name = "LEGO Super Mario",
                    Count = 2,
                    UnitPrice = 60,
                    TotalPrice = 200
                }
            }
        });
        
        return LocalRedirectPreserveMethod("/Payment/GatewaySelection?paymentRequestId=" + paymentRequest.Id);
    }
}
```

If the payment is successful, payment module will return to configured ```PaymentWebOptions.CallbackUrl```. The main application can take necessary actions for a successful payment (Activating a user account, triggering a shipment start process etc...).

## Subscriptions

This module also implements recurring payments;

* Supports only [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) for now.

You can start a subscription and get recurring payment from your customers using payment gateways supported by this module. It works different from one-time payment. Payment module works with events over webhooks of selected gateway. It creates a local payment request record like one-time payment, but it tracks that payment request in every period that customer pays and publishes events for cancels, updates and continues.

![payment-module-flow](../images/payment-module-subscription-flow.png)

### Enabling WebHooks

Configuring Web Hooks is highly important for subscriptions otherwise your application won't be able to get subscription changes, such as canceled or updated states. Each gateway has its own configuration:

#### Stripe

1. Go to [WebHooks on Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Create a new webhook via using **Add endpoint** button.
   - **Endpoint URL**:  `yourdomain.com/api/payment/stripe/webhook`
   - **Events to send**: 
     - `customer.subscription.created`
     - `customer.subscription.deleted`
     - `customer.subscription.updated`
     - `checkout.session.completed` (optional) _If you don't set this, payment will be proceed with callback._
3. Stripe will create a webhook secret key. Copy that and configure it as `WebhookSecret` under [StripeOptions](#stripeoptions).

### Configuring Plans

Before starting a recurring payment, **Plan** and **GatewayPlan** must be configured properly. 

1. Go to your payment gateway (Stripe) dashboard and create product & pricing.
2. Create a **Plan** entity in your application.
3. Go to 'Manage Gateway Plans' section and create a new **GatewayPlan** for gateway and paste price or product id as `ExternalId`.

### Creating a Tenant-Edition Subscription

Follow [saas](saas.md#tenant-edition-subscription) documentation.

### Creating a Recurring Payment

Creating a recurring payment almost same as creating a payment. Setting `PaymentType` property as **Recurring** and passing `PlanId` are enough to start a recurring payment request. If given Plan has multiple GatewayPlan, user will be able to choose gateway to pay.

> Redirection of the gateway selection page has to be a **POST** request. If you implement it as a **GET** request, you will get an error. You can use `LocalRedirectPreserveMethod` to keep the method as POST in the redirected request.

```csharp
public class SubscriptionModel : PageModel
{
    private IPaymentRequestAppService PaymentRequestAppService { get; }

    public SubscriptionModel(IPaymentRequestAppService paymentRequestAppService)
    {
        PaymentRequestAppService = paymentRequestAppService;
    }

    public virtual async Task<IActionResult> OnPostAsync()
    {
        var paymentRequest = await PaymentRequestAppService.CreateAsync(
            new PaymentRequestCreateDto()
            {
                Products =
                {
                    new PaymentRequestProductCreateDto
                    {
                        PaymentType = PaymentType.Subscription,
                        Name = "Enterprise Plan",
                        Code = "EP",
                        Count = 1,
                        // Place your created PlanId below.
                        PlanId = DemoAppData.Plan_2_Id, 
                    }
                }
            });

        return LocalRedirectPreserveMethod("/Payment/GatewaySelection?paymentRequestId=" + paymentRequest.Id);
    }
}
```

> To track that subscription is continuing or canceled, you should keep the SubscriptionId, all events contain it.
