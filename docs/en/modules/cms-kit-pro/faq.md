# CMS Kit Pro: FAQ System

> You must have an ABP Team or a higher license to use CMS Kit Pro module's features.

The CMS kit provides a **FAQ** system to allow users to create, edit and delete FAQ's. Here is a screenshot of the FAQ widget:

## Enabling the FAQ System

By default, CMS Kit features are disabled. Therefore, you need to enable the features you want, before starting to use it. You can use the [Global Feature](../../framework/infrastructure/global-features.md) system to enable/disable CMS Kit features on development time. Alternatively, you can use the ABP Framework's [Feature System](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Features) to disable a CMS Kit feature on runtime.

> Check the ["How to Install" section of the CMS Kit Module documentation](index.md#how-to-install) to see how to enable/disable CMS Kit features on development time.

## User Interface

### Menu Items

## Faq Widget

The FAQ system provides a FAQ [widget](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/UI/AspNetCore/Widgets) for users to display FAQ's. You can place the widget on a page like below:

```csharp
@await Component.InvokeAsync(
    typeof(FaqViewComponent),
    new
    {
        groupName = "Community",
        name = "Development"
    })
```

`FaqViewComponent` parameters:
- `groupName` (optional): It allows to specify which FAQ group to show. If not specified, all groups will be shown.
- `sectionName` (optional): It is used to determine which section within the specified group will be shown. If not specified, all sections in the related group will be shown.

The FAQ system can also be used in combination with the [dynamic widget](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Modules/Cms-Kit/Dynamic-Widget) feature.

## Options

The FAQ system provides a mechanism to group sections by group name. For example, if you want to use the FAQ system for  community and support page, you need to define two group names named Community and Support and add sections under these groups. So, before using the FAQ system, you need to define groups. For that, you can use `FaqOptions`. `FaqOptions` can be configured at the domain layer, in the `ConfigureServices` method of your [module](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Module-Development-Basics).

```csharp
Configure<FaqOptions>(options =>
{
    options.SetGroups(new[] { "General", "Community", "Support" });
});
```

`FaqOptions` properties:

- `Groups`: Dictionary of defined groups in the FAQ system. The `options.SetGroups` method is a shortcut to add a new groups to this dictionary.
