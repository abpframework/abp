# Switch to EF Core Oracle Provider

This document explains how to switch to the **Oracle** database provider for **[the application startup template](Startup-Templates/Application.md)** which comes with SQL Server provider pre-configured.

ABP Framework provides integrations for two different Oracle packages. See one of the following documents based on your provider decision:

* **[Volo.Abp.EntityFrameworkCore.Oracle](Entity-Framework-Core-Oracle-Official.md)** package uses the official & free oracle driver.
* **[Volo.Abp.EntityFrameworkCore.Oracle.Devart](Entity-Framework-Core-Oracle-Devart.md)** package uses the commercial (paid) driver of [Devart](https://www.devart.com/) company.

> You can choose one of the package you want. If you don't know the differences of the packages, please search for it. ABP Framework only provides integrations it doesn't provide support for such 3rd-party libraries.
