# The Official Themes
ABP Framework provides a complete UI theming system. While you can build your own themes, you can use the following pre-built themes freely in your applications.

## The Basic Theme
The Basic Theme is a minimalist theme that doesn't add any styling on top of the plain [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) styles. You can take the Basic Theme as the base theme and build your own theme or styling on top of it. Here, a screenshot from the theme:
