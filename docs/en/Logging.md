# Logging

ABP Framework doesn't implement any logging infrastructure. It uses the [ASP.NET Core's logging system](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging).

> .NET Core's logging system is actually independent from the ASP.NET Core. It is usable in any type of application.
