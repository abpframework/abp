# ABP.IO Platform 7.2 Final Has Been Released!

[ABP Framework](https://abp.io/) and [ABP Commercial](https://commercial.abp.io/) 7.2 versions have been released today.

## What's New With Version 7.2?

All the new features were already explained in detail in the [7.2 RC Announcement Post](https://blog.abp.io/abp/ABP.IO-Platform-7.2-RC-Has-Been-Published), so no need to go over them again. Check it out for more details. 

## Getting Started with 7.2

### Creating New Solutions

You can create a new solution with the ABP Framework version 7.2 by either using the `abp new` command or generating the CLI command on the [get started page](https://abp.io/get-started).

> See the [getting started document](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Getting-Started) for more.

### How to Upgrade an Existing Solution

#### Install/Update the ABP CLI

First of all, install the ABP CLI or upgrade it to the latest version.

If you haven't installed it yet:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g Volo.Abp.Cli
```

To update the existing CLI:

```bash
dotnet tool update -g Volo.Abp.Cli
```

#### Upgrading Existing Solutions with the ABP Update Command

[ABP CLI](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/CLI) provides a handy command to update all the ABP related NuGet and NPM packages in your solution with a single command:

```bash
abp update
```

Run this command in the root folder of your solution.
