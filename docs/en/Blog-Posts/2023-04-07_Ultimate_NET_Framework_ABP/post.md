Building robust web applications has become more important than ever as the world is becoming more web-focused. With the rise of new tools and frameworks, choosing the right web development framework can be challenging. Especially if you are a .NET developer, there not so many popular ASPNET Framework around. However, the ABP Framework has become popular for many developers due to its flexibility, scalability, feature set and performance. Let's mention what's ABP Framework and what it promises to .NET developers.

## ASP.NET Core Architecture Best Practices

![ABP Key Features](images/key-features.png)

ABP Framework is an application design framework that provides developers with a powerful set of tools to build web applications quickly and efficiently. It is an open-source, cross-platform framework supporting monolithic and microservices architectures. ABP Framework is built on top of the ASP.NET Core architecture and incorporates best practices for developing web applications.

## ASP.NET Platform

The framework includes a wide range of features, such as an angular code generator with the help of [ABP Suite](https://commercial.abp.io/tools/suite), project templates, and web application themes. These features enable developers to create web applications that are both functional and visually appealing without spending much time on coding. Moreover, ABP Framework provides a common application framework that can be used for different applications, including SAAS, e-commerce, and social media platforms.

ABP Framework also supports the domain-driven design, which means that the framework is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different business requirements. This approach allows developers to build applications aligned with business needs, ensuring that they are efficient and effective.

## Open Source Dot Net Framework

One of the major advantages of ABP Framework is its open-source nature. Many developers continuously improve and update the framework, making it more reliable and secure. Moreover, the ABP Framework is compatible with multiple .NET frameworks, including ASP.NET and .NET Core. When starting your project on top of a solid Microsoft web framework, the ABP Framework is one of the best choices.

Another advantage of ABP Framework is that it provides rapid web application development tools that are easy to use. The framework includes project templates that developers can use as a starting point for their web applications, which can significantly reduce the development time. ABP Framework also provides a web app builder that developers can use to create web applications quickly and efficiently.

## ASPNET Core Architecture

ABP Framework is also compatible with Microsoft's Clean Architecture, a software design pattern that promotes separation of concerns and maintainability. This integration ensures that the applications developed using ABP Framework are well-structured, easy to maintain, and scalable. Many application marketplace reviewers commented about ABP as the best web application framework. While ABP supports multiple UI choices like MVC, Angular, Blazor Web Assembly and Blazor Server, the most downloaded one is MVC microservice architecture. If you are here to find a NET application framework for your next NET Core application, you are in the right place!

Clean Architecture is a design pattern that emphasizes the separation of concerns, ensuring that the code is organized in independent layers. This helps developers to write code that is easy to maintain, test and refactor. ABP Framework uses this pattern to structure its application code and ensure that it is easy to manage.

## Open Source Web Framework

ABP Framework is an open-source web framework that is free to use and distribute. The framework is licensed under the MIT license, meaning developers can use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes without any restrictions.

ABP Framework provides different templates, which are ASPNET Core web app compatible with various platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. 

## Domain Driven Design DotNet

The ABP Framework also implements Domain-Driven Design (DDD), a software design methodology that emphasizes the importance of the domain model. The framework provides a guide for implementing DDD through an implementing domain-driven design. It helps developers to create a domain model that is easy to understand, test, and maintain. As ABP is a C# framework, it supports most of the common application framework features for a core framework.

There is also a free PDF e-book for Dotnet developers that explains the Domain Driven Design principle with real-world examples. You can download this e-book at https://abp.io/books/implementing-domain-driven-design

## It's a Dotnet Web Framework

ABP Framework is a dotnet web framework that is designed with C# and provides developers with a set of tools that makes it easy to build modern web applications. Whether you want to start a new dotnet monolithic solution or dotnet microservice solution, you can start with ABP. Creating your own dotnet framework architecture may be hard if you don't have many years of experience. The brain team of the ABP Framework specializes in ASP.NET framework architecture and ASP.NET application frameworks.
