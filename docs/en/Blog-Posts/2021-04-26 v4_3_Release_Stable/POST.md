# ABP.IO Platform 4.3 Final Has Been Released!

[ABP Framework](https://abp.io/) and [ABP Commercial](https://commercial.abp.io/) 4.3 versions have been released today.

## What's New With 4.3?

Since all the new features are already explained in details with the 4.3 RC announcement posts, I will not repeat all the details again. See the related blog posts for all the features and enhancements;

## The Quick Start Tutorial

With this version, we've created a minimalist [quick start tutorial](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Tutorials/Todo/Index) for developers who are new to the ABP Framework.

## How to Upgrade an Existing Solution

### Install/Update the ABP CLI

First of all, install the ABP CLI or upgrade to the latest version.

If you haven't installed yet:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g Volo.Abp.Cli
```

To update an existing installation:

```bash
dotnet tool update -g Volo.Abp.Cli
```

### ABP UPDATE Command

[ABP CLI](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/CLI) provides a handy command to update all the ABP related NuGet and NPM packages in your solution with a single command:

```bash
abp update
```

Run this command in the root folder of your solution.
