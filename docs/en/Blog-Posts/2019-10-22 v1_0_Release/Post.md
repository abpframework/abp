Here, a few GitHub & NuGet statistics about the project:

* 2,360 stars.
* 5,917 commits.
* 72 contributors.
* 1,136 issues were closed, 276 open.
* 566 PRs were closed, 5 open.
* 39 releases.
* 122,795 downloads on NuGet.

There was an excellent demand even before the first release.

## Road Map

The first priority is to complete the documentation, since there are still a lot of missing documents for the framework features & the modules. Then we will continue to work on the issues on GitHub, based on the labeled priorities.

See the [GitHub milestone items](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/milestones).

ABP is a community-driven project. So, we are prioritizing the issues mostly based on the community feedback and demand.
