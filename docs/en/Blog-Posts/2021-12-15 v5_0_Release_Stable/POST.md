# ABP.IO Platform 5.0 Final Has Been Released!

[ABP Framework](https://abp.io/) and [ABP Commercial](https://commercial.abp.io/) 5.0 versions have been released today.

## What's new with 5.0?

Since all the new features are already explained in details with the [5.0 RC.1 Announcement Post](https://blog.abp.io/abp/ABP-IO-Platform-5.0-RC-1-Has-Been-Released), I will not repeat all the details again. See the [RC Blog Post](https://blog.abp.io/abp/ABP-IO-Platform-5.0-RC-1-Has-Been-Released) for all the features and enhancements.

## Getting started with 5.0

### Creating new solutions

You can create a new solution with the ABP Framework version 5.0 by either using the `abp new` command or using the **direct download** tab on the [get started page](https://abp.io/get-started).

Type the following command in a command-line terminal to install the ABP CLI version 5.0:

````bash
dotnet tool install -g Volo.Abp.Cli --version 5.0.0
````

To upgrade your existing ABP CLI installation:

````bash
dotnet tool update -g Volo.Abp.Cli --version 5.0.0
````

Then you can create a new solution using the `abp new` command:

````bash
abp new Acme.BookStore
````

> See the [getting started document](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Getting-Started) for details.

### Upgrading existing solutions

Check [the migration guide](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Migration-Guides/Abp-5_0) for the applications with the version 4.x upgrading to the version 5.0. Also see [the upgrading guide](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Upgrading) to understand how to update existing solutions.
