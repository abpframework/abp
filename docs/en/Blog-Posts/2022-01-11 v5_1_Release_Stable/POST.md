# ABP.IO Platform 5.1 Has Been Released

Today, we are releasing the [ABP Framework](https://abp.io/) and [ABP Commercial](https://commercial.abp.io/) version 5.1 (with a version number `5.1.1`). This blog post introduces the new features and important changes in this new version.

> **Warning**
>
> For a long time we've been releasing RC (Release Candidate) versions a few weeks prior to every minor and major release. **This version has been released without a preview version.** This is because we've accidently released all the packages with a stable version number, without a `-rc.1` suffix and there is no clear way to unpublish all the NuGet and NPM packages. We're sorry about that. However, it doesn't mean that this release is buggy. We've already resolved the known problems. We will publish one or more patch releases if needed. You can follow [this milestone](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/milestone/64?closed=1) for the common problems or submit your own bug report. If you are worried about its stability, you can wait for the next patch release.

## Get Started with 5.1

Follow the steps below to try the 5.1 version today:

1) **Upgrade** the ABP CLI to the latest version using a command line terminal:

````bash
dotnet tool update Volo.Abp.Cli -g
````

**or install** if you haven't installed it before:

````bash
dotnet tool install Volo.Abp.Cli -g
````

2) Create a **new application**:

````bash
abp new BookStore
````

Check out the [ABP CLI documentation](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/CLI) for all the available options.

> You can also use the *Direct Download* tab on the [Get Started](https://abp.io/get-started) page.

You can use any IDE that supports .NET 6.x development (e.g. [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)).

### Migration Notes & Breaking Changes

This is a minor feature release, mostly with enhancements and improvements based on [version 5.0](https://blog.abp.io/abp/ABP-IO-Platform-5-0-Final-Has-Been-Released). There aren't any breaking changes except for the Angular UI upgrade. ABP 5.1 startup templates use **Angular 13**.

### Angular UI

**If you want to upgrade the ABP Framework but want to continue with Angular 12**, add the following section to the `package.json` file of the Angular project:

````json
"resolutions": {
    "ng-zorro-antd": "^12.1.1",
    "@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap": "11.0.0-beta.2"
  }
````

### Blazor UI

If you are using Blazor WebAssembly, open the `Program` class and replace `InitializeAsync` with `InitializeApplicationAsync`.

## What's New with the ABP Framework 5.1?

In this section, I will introduce some major features released with this version.

### The New Hosting Model

The ABP startup application template now uses the new ASP.NET Core hosting APIs ([check out the Microsoft's minimal APIs document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis?view=aspnetcore-6.0)) on application startup ([check out the exact place in the ABP startup template](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/blob/46cdfbe7b06c93690181633be4e96bf62e7f34e2/templates/app/aspnet-core/src/MyCompanyName.MyProjectName.Web/Program.cs#L33-L40)). So, the `Startup.cs` file has been removed.

Old-style hosting logic will continue to work as long as ASP.NET Core supports it. It is recommended to switch to the new model if it's possible for your solution. Check out [this guide](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Migration-Guides/Upgrading-Startup-Template) if you need to know how to do that.

### Asynchronous Startup Lifecycle Methods

The new hosting model allows us to execute asynchronous code on application initialization in the [ABP module](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Module-Development-Basics) classes. If you are using the new hosting model (which is default with 5.1 startup templates), you can override the `Async` versions of the module lifecycle methods.

For example, you can now override the `ConfigureServicesAsync` (instead of `ConfigureServices`) or `OnApplicationInitializationAsync` (instead of `OnApplicationInitialization`) as shown in the following code block:

````csharp
public class MyModule : AbpModule
{
    public override async Task ConfigureServicesAsync(ServiceConfigurationContext context)
    {
        /* You can use await here and safely execute other async methods */
    }

    public override async Task OnApplicationInitializationAsync(ApplicationInitializationContext context)
    {
        /* You can use await here and safely execute other async methods */
    }
}
````

If you override both the asynchronous and synchronous versions of the same method, only the asynchronous one will be executed. So, override only one of them based on your needs.

### eShopOnABP Is Getting More Stable

Our team is working to finalize the [eShopOnAbp](https://github.com/abpframework/eShopOnAbp) example solution, which is a reference **microservice solution** built with the ABP Framework. They will explain the project status and show what's done in the next **ABP Community Talks** meeting (Check out the *ABP Community Talks 2021.1* section at the bottom of this post).

### The New ABP.IO Design!

We've been working on a new design for the [abp.io](https://abp.io/) websites for a while. We are adding the final touches; the new design will be live very soon. Here's a screenshot from the design work:

![new-abp-io-design](new-abp-io-design.png)

The [ABP Commercial](https://commercial.abp.io/) and [ABP Community](https://community.abp.io/) websites will also have new designs as part of this update.

### Other Changes

Here are some other notable changes that come with this release:

* Support markdown in [CMS-Kit comments ](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Modules/Cms-Kit/Comments)feature ([#10792](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/pull/10792))
* Used file scoped namespaces for all the ABP Framework source code :) ([#10552](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/pull/10696))
* Developers should control `EnableLegacyTimestampBehavior` when using PostgreSQL. [#11371](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/pull/11371) [#65](https://github.com/abpframework/eShopOnAbp/pull/65)


All issues & PRs in [5.1 milesone](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/milestone/60?closed=1).

### About  ABP Commercial

The core team is also working on ABP Commercial (which provides pre-built modules, themes, tooling and support on top of the ABP Framework). We've done a lot of minor improvements and fixes to the modules and tooling.

There's some exciting news about the **LeptonX theme**; We are working on making it available in the **MVC (Razor Pages)** and **Blazor** UI options too (in addition to Angular UI). We are also adding more components, layout options, demo pages, etc... We are planning to release a beta version in the next weeks. Here's an animated GIF from the dashboard we've prepared as a demonstration:

![leptonx-dash](leptonx-dash.gif)

If you are wondering what is the LeptonX project, please check out this [blog post](https://blog.abp.io/abp/LeptonX-Theme-for-ABP-Framework-Alpha-Release).

As another visible functionality, we've added a new feature to the [CMS Kit Pro](https://docs.abp.io/en/commercial/latest/modules/cms-kit/index) module that is used to forward a URL to another URL. This is a screenshot from the management UI:

![url-forward](url-forward.png)

This feature can be used to create short URLs in your application (like URL shortening services providers) or forward old pages to their new URLs.

In addition to the new features shipped in every minor version, we are working on long-term projects for ABP.IO Platform and ABP Commercial (a little secret for now :). We will have announcements once these projects get more stable.
