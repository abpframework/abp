# ABP.IO Platform 8.0 Has Been Released Based on .NET 8.0

Today, [ABP Framework](https://abp.io/) and [ABP Commercial](https://commercial.abp.io/) 8.0 versions have been released based on [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).

## What's New With Version 8.0?

All the new features were explained in detail in the [8.0 RC Announcement Post](https://blog.abp.io/abp/announcing-abp-8-0-release-candidate), so there is no need to review them again. You can check it out for more details. 

## Getting Started with 8.0

### Creating New Solutions

You can create a new solution with the ABP Framework version 8.0 by either using the `abp new` command or generating the CLI command on the [get started page](https://abp.io/get-started).

> See the [getting started document](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Getting-Started) for more.

### How to Upgrade an Existing Solution

#### Install/Update the ABP CLI

First, install the ABP CLI or upgrade it to the latest version.

If you haven't installed it yet:

```bash

```

To update the existing CLI:

```bash

```

#### Upgrading Existing Solutions with the ABP Update Command

[ABP CLI](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/CLI) provides a handy command to update all the ABP related NuGet and NPM packages in your solution with a single command:

Run this command in the root folder of your solution.
