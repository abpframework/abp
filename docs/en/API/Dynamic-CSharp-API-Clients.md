# Dynamic C# API Clients

ABP can dynamically create C# API client proxies to call remote HTTP services (REST APIs). In this way, you don't need to deal with `HttpClient` and other low level HTTP features to call remote services and get results.

## Service Interface

Your service/controller should implement an interface that is shared between the server and the client. So, first define a service interface in a shared library project. Example:

````csharp
public interface IBookAppService : IApplicationService
{
    Task<List<BookDto>> GetListAsync();
}
````

Your interface should implement the `IRemoteService` interface to be automatically discovered. Since the `IApplicationService` inherits the `IRemoteService` interface, the `IBookAppService` above satisfies this condition.

Implement this class in your service application. You can use [auto API controller system](Auto-API-Controllers.md) to expose the service as a REST API endpoint.

## Client Proxy Generation

First, add [Volo.Abp.Http.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Volo.Abp.Http.Client) nuget package to your client project:

````
Install-Package Volo.Abp.Http.Client
````

Then add `AbpHttpClientModule` dependency to your module:

````csharp
[DependsOn(typeof(AbpHttpClientModule))] //add the dependency
public class MyClientAppModule : AbpModule
{
}
````

Now, it's ready to create the client proxies. Example:

````csharp
[DependsOn(
    typeof(AbpHttpClientModule), //used to create client proxies
    typeof(BookStoreApplicationModule) //contains the application service interfaces
    )]
public class MyClientAppModule : AbpModule
{
    public override void ConfigureServices(ServiceConfigurationContext context)
    {
        //Create dynamic client proxies
        context.Services.AddHttpClientProxies(
            typeof(BookStoreApplicationModule).Assembly
        );
    }
}
````

`AddHttpClientProxies` method gets an assembly, finds all service interfaces in the given assembly, creates and registers proxy classes.

### Endpoint Configuration

`RemoteServices` section in the `appsettings.json` file is used to get remote service address by default. Simplest configuration is shown below:

````
{
  "RemoteServices": {
    "Default": {
      "BaseUrl": "http://localhost:53929/"
    } 
  } 
}
````

See the "AbpRemoteServiceOptions" section below for more detailed configuration.

## Usage

It's straightforward to use. Just inject the service interface in the client application code:

````csharp
public class MyService : ITransientDependency
{
    private readonly IBookAppService _bookService;

    public MyService(IBookAppService bookService)
    {
        _bookService = bookService;
    }

    public async Task DoIt()
    {
        var books = await _bookService.GetListAsync();
        foreach (var book in books)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"[BOOK {book.Id}] Name={book.Name}");
        }
    }
}
````

This sample injects the `IBookAppService` service interface defined above. The dynamic client proxy implementation makes an HTTP call whenever a service method is called by the client.

### IHttpClientProxy Interface

While you can inject `IBookAppService` like above to use the client proxy, you could inject `IHttpClientProxy<IBookAppService>` for a more explicit usage. In this case you will use the `Service` property of the `IHttpClientProxy<T>` interface.

## Configuration

### AbpRemoteServiceOptions

`AbpRemoteServiceOptions` is automatically set from the `appsettings.json` by default. Alternatively, you can use `Configure` method to set or override it. Example:

````csharp
public override void ConfigureServices(ServiceConfigurationContext context)
{
    context.Services.Configure<AbpRemoteServiceOptions>(options =>
    {
        options.RemoteServices.Default =
            new RemoteServiceConfiguration("http://localhost:53929/");
    });
    
    //...
}
````

### Multiple Remote Service Endpoints

The examples above have configured the "Default" remote service endpoint. You may have different endpoints for different services (as like in a microservice approach where each microservice has different endpoints). In this case, you can add other endpoints to your configuration file:

````json
{
  "RemoteServices": {
    "Default": {
      "BaseUrl": "http://localhost:53929/"
    },
    "BookStore": {
      "BaseUrl": "http://localhost:48392/"
    } 
  } 
}
````

`AddHttpClientProxies` method can get an additional parameter for the remote service name. Example:

````csharp
context.Services.AddHttpClientProxies(
    typeof(BookStoreApplicationModule).Assembly,
    remoteServiceName: "BookStore"
);
````

`remoteServiceName` parameter matches the service endpoint configured via `AbpRemoteServiceOptions`. If the `BookStore` endpoint is not defined then it fallbacks to the `Default` endpoint.

### As Default Services

When you create a service proxy for `IBookAppService`, you can directly inject the `IBookAppService` to use the proxy client (as shown in the usage section). You can pass `asDefaultServices: false` to the `AddHttpClientProxies` method to disable this feature.

````csharp
context.Services.AddHttpClientProxies(
    typeof(BookStoreApplicationModule).Assembly,
    asDefaultServices: false
);
````

Using `asDefaultServices: false` may only be needed if your application has already an implementation of the service and you do not want to override/replace the other implementation by your client proxy.

> If you disable `asDefaultServices`, you can only use `IHttpClientProxy<T>` interface to use the client proxies (see the related section above).
