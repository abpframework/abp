### Architecture

<img src="docs/en/images/ddd-microservice-simple.png">

ABP offers a complete, **modular** and **layered** software architecture based on **[Domain Driven Design](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Domain-Driven-Design)** principles and patterns. It also provides the necessary infrastructure and guiding to [implement this architecture](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Domain-Driven-Design-Implementation-Guide).

ABP Framework is suitable for **[microservice solutions](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Microservice-Architecture)** as well as monolithic applications.

### Infrastructure

There are a lot of features provided by the ABP Framework to achieve real world scenarios easier, like [Event Bus](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Event-Bus), [Background Job System](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Background-Jobs), [Audit Logging](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Audit-Logging), [BLOB Storing](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Blob-Storing), [Data Seeding](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Data-Seeding), [Data Filtering](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Data-Filtering), etc.

### Cross Cutting Concerns

ABP also simplifies (and even automates wherever possible) cross cutting concerns and common non-functional requirements like [Exception Handling](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Exception-Handling), [Validation](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Validation), [Authorization](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Authorization), [Localization](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Localization), [Caching](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Caching), [Dependency Injection](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Dependency-Injection), [Setting Management](https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Settings), etc.
