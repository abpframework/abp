# Contributing to ABP Angular UI

We would love for you to contribute to ABP Angular UI and help make it even better than it is today.

# Development

Run `yarn`Â to install all dependencies, then run `yarn prepare:workspace` to prepare the ABP packages (might take 2 minutes).

Run `yarn start` to start the `dev-app`. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/.

## Package

[Symlink Manager](https://github.com/mehmet-erim/symlink-manager) is used to manage symbolic link processes. Run `yarn symlink copy` to select the packages to develop.

## Application

The `dev-app` project is the same as the Angular UI template project. `dev-app` is used to see changes instantly.

If you will only develop the `dev-app`, you don't need to run `symlink-manager`.

> Reminder! If you have developed the `dev-app` template, you should do the same for the application and module templates.

For more information, see the [docs.abp.io](https://docs.abp.io)

# Committing changes

Before you commit, please ensure that your code passes the existing unit tests.

New features should be accompanied by new tests.

Every commit should contain only the changes related to the subject of that commit.

## Commit message format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

The footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) if any.

```
docs(changelog): update changelog to beta.5
```

```
fix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js

The version in our package.json gets copied to the one we publish, and users need the latest of these.
```

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scope: scripts)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

### Scope

The scope should be the name of the npm package affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog generated from commit messages).

The following is the list of supported scopes:

- **core**
- **theme-shared**
- **theme-basic**
- **account**
- **identity**
- **tenant-management**
- **feature-management**
- **permission-management**
- **setting-management**
- **account-config**
- **identity-config**
- **setting-management-config**
- **tenant-management-config**

There are currently a few exceptions to the "use package name" rule:

- **packaging**: used for changes that change the npm package layout in all of our packages, e.g.
  public path changes, package.json changes done to all packages, d.ts file/format changes, changes
  to bundles, etc.
- **scripts**: used for changes that change any script.
- **template**: used for changes that change `dev-app` and `app` template applications.
- **changelog**: used for updating the release notes in CHANGELOG.md
- none/empty string: useful for `style`, `test` and `refactor` changes that are done across all
  packages (e.g. `style: add missing semicolons`) and for docs changes that are not related to a
  specific package (e.g. `docs: fix typo in tutorial`).

### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
