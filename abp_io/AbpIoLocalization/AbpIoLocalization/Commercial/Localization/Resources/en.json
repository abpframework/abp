The modularity of ABP made it possible for the team to deliver in record time, pass all VAPT, and deploy the containerized microservices stack via full CI/CD and pipelines into production.",
    "Pricing_Page_Testimonial_2": "We see the value of using ABP Commercial to reduce the overhead of custom development projects. And the team is able to unify the code pattern in different project streams. We see more potential in the framework for us to build new features faster than before. We trust we will be constantly seeing the value of leveraging ABP Commercial.",
    "Pricing_Page_Testimonial_3": "We love ABP. We don't have to write everything from scratch. We start from out-of-the-box features and just focus on what we really need to write. Also, ABP is well-architected and the code is high quality with fewer bugs. If we would have to write everything we needed on our own, we might have to spend years. Once more things we like is that the new version, or issue fixing, or improvement come out very soon every other week. We don't wait too long.",
    "Pricing_Page_Testimonial_4": "ABP Commercial is a fantastic product would recommend. Commercial products to market for our customers in a single configurable platform. The jump starts that the framework and tooling provide any team is worth every cent. ABP Commercial was the best fit for our needs.",
    "Pricing_Page_Testimonial_5": "ABP Framework is not only a framework, but it is also a guide for project development/management, because it provides DDD, GenericRepository, DI, Microservice, and Modularity training. Even if you are not going to use the framework itself, you can develop yourself with docs.abp.io which is well and professionally prepared (OpenIddict, Redis, Quartz etc.). Because many things are pre-built, it shortens project development time significantly (Such as login page, exception handling, data filtering, seeding, audit logging, localization, auto API controller etc.). As an example from our application, I have used Local Event Bus for stock control. So, I am able to manage order movements by writing stock handler. It is wonderful not to lose time for CreationTime, CreatorId. They are being filled automatically.",
    "Pricing_Page_Testimonial_6": "ABP Framework is a good framework but it needs time to understand the different layers, classes, and libraries it uses (specially ABP). I spent a lot of time reading the code base, but ABP Commercial saved us time to create the project specialty entities (AR) and the repository linked to each of them. I liked also the approach used in ABP is very mature, we know is based on DDD and monolith.",
    "Pricing_Page_Testimonial_7": "As a startup, we need to iterate quickly and spend minimal time on boilerplate and non-core features.\nOur engineers range from highly experienced to junior engineers, we needed a common understanding and a way to share technical and domain knowledge, ABP allowed us to do this due to their great guides and documentation. \nThere are things we haven't had to worry about since they work out of the box with ABP. \nABP helped us streamline rapid prototyping and development, less than 4 weeks from feature inception to production. With all its premium features included in the license, ABP has given us, \"Startup in a Box\" on the Software Engineering Side.",
    "Pricing_Page_Testimonial_8": "I would recommend ABP commercial to all those who want to expand the range of products available to their customers. It's fantastic when need to use a distributed enterprise environment (Angular, WPF, Win&Linux). In addition to their products, we love their support, which makes our job faster and easier. We already know that we have found a great partner for the future who will support us in expanding our business.",
    "Pricing_Page_Testimonial_9": "We are a company of 2 employees that's been in business for over 20 years.\nIn terms of our experience with ABP Commercial, we were approached by a client who requested that we develop a new human resources application in a modern environment to replace their 25-year-old Access application. We decided to transition from a desktop solution to a web-based one.\n\nAt the time, we had very little knowledge of web applications and .NET but we stumbled upon ABP Commercial, and with the help of ABP Framework, technical documentation, and ABP Suite, we were able to not only develop the application to the client's specifications but also successfully work within a .NET environment within a year.",
