The modularity of ABP made it possible for the team to deliver in record time, pass all VAPT, and deploy the containerized microservices stack via full CI/CD and pipelines into production.",
    "Pricing_Page_Testimonial_2": "We see the value of using ABP Commercial to reduce the overhead of custom development projects. The team is able to unify the code pattern in different project streams. We see more potential in the framework for us to build new features faster than before. We trust we will be constantly seeing the value of leveraging ABP Commercial.",
    "Pricing_Page_Testimonial_3": "We love ABP. We don't have to write everything from scratch. We start from out-of-the-box features and just focus on what we really need to write. Also, ABP is well-architected and the code is high quality with fewer bugs. If we had to write everything we needed on our own, we might have to spend years. One more thing we like is that the new version, issue fixing, or improvement comes out very soon every other week. We don't wait too long.",
    "Pricing_Page_Testimonial_4": "ABP Commercial is a fantastic product would recommend. Commercial products to market for our customers in a single configurable platform. The jump starts that the framework and tooling provide any team is worth every cent. ABP Commercial was the best fit for our needs.",
    "Pricing_Page_Testimonial_5": "ABP Framework is not only a framework, but it is also a guide for project development/management, because it provides DDD, GenericRepository, DI, Microservice, and Modularity training. Even if you are not going to use the framework itself, you can develop yourself with docs.abp.io which is well and professionally prepared (OpenIddict, Redis, Quartz etc.). Because many things are pre-built, it shortens project development time significantly (Such as login page, exception handling, data filtering, seeding, audit logging, localization, auto API controller etc.). As an example from our application, I have used Local Event Bus for stock control. So, I am able to manage order movements by writing stock handler. It is wonderful not to lose time for CreationTime, CreatorId. They are being filled automatically.",
    "Pricing_Page_Testimonial_6": "ABP Framework is a good framework but it needs time to understand the different layers, classes, and libraries it uses (especially ABP). I spent a lot of time reading the code base, but ABP Commercial saved us time in creating the project specialty entities (AR) and the repository linked to each of them. I liked also the approach used in ABP is very mature; we know is based on DDD and monolith.",
    "Pricing_Page_Testimonial_7": "As a startup, we need to iterate quickly and spend minimal time on boilerplate and non-core features.\nOur engineers range from highly experienced to junior engineers, and we needed a common understanding and a way to share technical and domain knowledge, ABP allowed us to do this due to their great guides and documentation. \nThere are things we haven't had to worry about since they work out of the box with ABP. \nABP helped us streamline rapid prototyping and development, less than 4 weeks from feature inception to production. With all its premium features included in the license, ABP has given us, \"Startup in a Box\" on the Software Engineering Side.",
    "Pricing_Page_Testimonial_8": "I would recommend ABP commercial to all those who want to expand the range of products available to their customers. It's fantastic when need to use a distributed enterprise environment (Angular, WPF, Win&Linux). In addition to their products, we love their support, which makes our job faster and easier. We already know that we have found a great partner for the future who will support us in expanding our business.",
    "Pricing_Page_Testimonial_9": "We are a company of 2 employees that's been in business for over 20 years.\nIn terms of our experience with ABP Commercial, we were approached by a client who requested that we develop a new human resources application in a modern environment to replace their 25-year-old Access application. We decided to transition from a desktop solution to a web-based one.\n\nAt the time, we had very little knowledge of web applications and .NET, but we stumbled upon ABP Commercial, and with the help of ABP Framework, technical documentation, and ABP Suite, we were able to not only develop the application to the client's specifications but also successfully work within a .NET environment within a year.",

    "EnterpriseApplicationRequirements_ABPSOLUTION_Description": "ABP provides an infrastructure to implement such requirements easily. Again, you don't spend your valuable time to re-implement all these again and again.",
    "GeneratingInitialCode&Tooling": "Generating Initial Code & Tooling",
    "GeneratingInitialCode&Tooling_THEPROBLEM_Description": "You will build many similar pages in a typical web application. Most of them will perform similar CRUD operations. It is very tedious and also error-prone to repeatedly create such pages.",
    "GeneratingInitialCode&Tooling_ABPSOLUTION_Description": "<a href=\"/tools/suite\">ABP Suite</a> can generate a full-stack CRUD page for your entities in seconds. The generated code is layered and clean. All the standard validation and authorization requirements are implemented. Plus, unit test classes are generated. Once you get a fully running page, you can modify it according to your business requirements.",
    "IntegratingTo3rdPartyLibrariesAndSystems": "Integrating to 3rd-Party Libraries and Systems",
    "IntegratingTo3rdPartyLibrariesAndSystems_THEPROBLEM_Description": "Most libraries are designed as low level, and you typically do some work to integrate them properly without repeating the same integration and configuration code everywhere in your solution. For example, assume you must use RabbitMQ to implement your distributed event bus. All you want to do is; send a message to a queue and handle the incoming messages. But you need to understand messaging patterns, queues and exchange details. To write efficient code, you must create a pool to manage connections, clients and channels. You also must deal with exceptions, ACK messages, re-connecting to RabbitMQ on failures and more.",
    "IntegratingTo3rdPartyLibrariesAndSystems_ABPSOLUTION_Description": "For example, ABP's RabbitMQ Distributed Event Bus integration abstracts all these details. You send and receive messages without the hustle and bustle. Do you need to write low-level code? No problem, you can always do that. ABP doesn't restrict you when you need to use low-level features of the library you are using.",
    "WhyNotBuildYourOwnFramework?": "Why Not Build Your Own Framework?",
    "WhyNotBuildYourOwnFramework_THEPROBLEM_Description": "All the infrastructure, even in the simplest way, takes a lot of time to build, maintain and document. It gets bigger over time, and it becomes hard to maintain it in your solution. Separating these into a re-usable project is the starting point for building your own internal framework.",
    "WhyNotBuildYourOwnFramework_THEPROBLEM_Description2": "Building, documenting, training and maintaining an internal framework is really hard. If you don't have an experienced, dedicated framework team, your internal framework rapidly becomes an undocumented legacy code that no one can understand and maintain anymore. On the other hand, these frameworks are generally developed by one or two developers in the team. And these fellows are becoming a knowledge silo. It is good for them but bad for the company because they are the project's single point of failure <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure\">-SPOF-</a>. Once they leave the company, the project dramatically goes down.",
    "WhyNotBuildYourOwnFramework_ABPSOLUTION_Description": "ABP Framework is a community-driven, well-documented, mature and generic application framework. A team of highly experienced developers are working hard to keep it up-to-date, easy to understand and comfortable to use. Using such a stable framework makes you focus on your own business code and get help with the framework from experts whenever you need it.",
    "ArchitecturalInfrastructure_Description": "SaaS applications, modular or microservice systems are most used enterprise software models. Building such systems not only requires a good understanding and experience but also requires a strong software infrastructure. Otherwise, you will find yourself spending a great effort to support these architectural details in your codebase.",
    "Modularity": "Modularity",
    "Modularity_THEPROBLEM_Description": "Building a truly modular system is not easy! All the aspects of the system (database, entities, APIs, UI pages/components) can be split into modules, and each module can be re-usable without others. The plain ASP.NET Core doesn't provide such a modular architecture. If you need it, you should think about it from scratch.",
    "Modularity_ABPSOLUTION_Description": "The ABP Framework is born to be a modular application development structure. Every feature in the framework is developed to be compatible with modularity. Documentation and guides explain how to develop re-usable modules in a standard way.",
    "SaaSMultiTenancy": "SaaS / Multi-Tenancy",
    "SaaSMultiTenancy_THEPROBLEM_Description": "<a href=\"https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Multi-Tenancy\">Multi-Tenancy</a> is a common way to implement SaaS systems. However, implementing a consistent multi-tenant infrastructure may become complicated.",
    "SaaSMultiTenancy_ABPSOLUTION_Description": "ABP Framework provides a complete multi-tenant infrastructure and abstract complexity from your business code. Your application code will be mostly multi-tenancy aware, while the ABP Framework automatically isolates the database, cache and other details of the tenants from each other. It supports single database, per tenant database and hybrid approaches. It properly configures the libraries like Microsoft Identity and OpenIddict, which are not normally multi-tenancy compatible.",
    "Microservices": "Microservices",
    "Microservices_THEPROBLEM_Description": "Building a microservice system requires many infrastructure details: Authenticating and authorizing applications and microservices and implementing asynchronous messaging and synchronous (Rest/GRPC) communication patterns between microservices are the most fundamental issues.",
    "Microservices_ABPSOLUTION_Description": "The ABP Framework provides services, <a href=\"https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Microservice-Architecture\" target=\"_blank\">guides</a>, and samples to help you implement your microservice solution using the industry standard tools.",
    "Microservices_ABPSOLUTION_Description2": "ABP Commercial even goes one step further and provides a complete <a href=\"https://docs.abp.io/en/commercial/latest/startup-templates/microservice/index\" target=\"_blank\">startup template</a> to kick-start your microservice solution.",
    "PreBuiltModules": "Pre-Built Modules",
    "PreBuiltModules_THEPROBLEM_Description": "All of us have similar but slightly different business requirements. However, we all should re-invent the wheel since no one's code can directly work in our solution. They are all embedded parts of a larger solution.",
    "PreBuiltModules_ABPSOLUTION_Description": "ABP Commercial <a href=\"/modules\">modules</a> provides a lot of re-usable application modules like payment, chat, file management, audit log reporting... etc. All of these modules are easily installed into your solution and directly work. We are constantly adding more modules.",
    "PreBuiltModules_ABPSOLUTION_Description2": "All modules are designed as customizable for your business requirements. If you need complete control, you can download the full source code of any module and completely customize based on your specific business requirements.",
    "ABPCommunity": "ABP Community",
    "ABPCommunity_Description": "Finally, Being in a big community where everyone follows similar coding styles and principles and shares a common infrastructure brings power when you have troubles or need help with design decisions. Since we write code similarly, we can help each other much better. ABP is a community-backed project with more than 10K stars on GitHub.",
    "ABPCommunity_Description2": "It is easy to share code or even re-usable libraries between ABP developers. A code snippet that works for you will also work for others. There are a lot of samples and tutorials that you can directly implement for your application.",
    "ABPCommunity_Description3": "When you hire a developer who worked before with the ABP architecture will immediately understand your solution and start development in a very short time.",
