Also, ABP is well-architected and the code is high quality with fewer bugs. If we would have to write everything we needed on our own, we might have to spend years.

    "Pricing_Page_Testimonial_5": "ABP Framework is not only a framework, but it is also a guide for project development/management, because it provides DDD, GenericRepository, DI, Microservice, and Modularity training. Even if you are not going to use the framework itself, you can develop yourself with docs.abp.io which is well and professionally prepared (OpenIddict, Redis, Quartz etc.). Because many things are pre-built, it shortens project development time significantly (Such as login page, exception handling, data filtering, seeding, audit logging, localization, auto API controller etc.). As an example from our application, I have used Local Event Bus for stock control. So, I am able to manage order movements by writing stock handler.
