The application's main menu provides three options: find asynchronous keys, apply changes in the exported file, or replace keys. Let's take a look at each option in more details.

If you choose to find asynchronous keys, you will be prompted to enter the default language path. Once entered, a multi-select menu will appear with all the JSON files in that folder. You can choose to find keys that do not match the number of arguments, missing keys, or both. If you choose to find the missing keys, you will be prompted to enter the absolute path to export the missing keys. Once entered, the export process will begin, and the application will close.

If you choose to find the keys that do not match the number of arguments, you can choose to delete, export, or both. If you choose to delete, the process will complete, and the application will close. If you choose to export, you will be prompted to enter the export path. Once entered, the export process will begin, and the application will close. If you choose to do both, both processes will complete, and the application will close.

If you choose to apply changes in the exported file, you will be prompted to import the file, and the process will complete.

 If you choose to replace keys, you will be prompted to enter the localization folder path, the old key, the new key, and select the JSON files where you want the changes to be made. Once all information is entered, the application will begin the replacement process, and it will close.
